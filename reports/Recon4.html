<br />
Here is a video of part 2 and 3.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<h1>Recon (2 of 3), Level 4</h1>

<br />
Faction: Mercenaries<br />
Mission type: Encounter<br />
Space type: Deadspace (MWD works)<br />
Damage dealt: All types (Thermal: 41%, Kin: 24%, EM: 21%, Exp: 14% from Ambush One.)<br />
Web/Scramble: Mercenary Wingman<br />
Extras: N/A<br />
Recommended damage dealing: Therm/Kin<br />
Recommended ship class: T2/T3 cruiser and higher or almost any fast ship to blitz.<br />
Video: <a class="ext" href="http://youtu.be/Xb4_KGaoI2M">Ishtar blitz</a>, <a class="ext" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TuC62x_bs9Y">Kronos Part 1,2 &amp; 3</a><br />
<br />
<h3>Pocket 1</h3>

<br />
No aggro upon warp-in. The locked acceleration gate (mission objective) is 72km away from the warp-in point.<br />
The Mining Corporation Headquarters station is about 10km away.<br />
<br />
Ambush Spawn 1 is triggered when the Mining Corporation Headquarters station is attacked OR when your ship is within 10km from locked acceleration gate.<br />
Ambush Spawn 2 is triggered when your ship is within 10km from locked acceleration gate.<br />
<br />
<img src="./screenshots/Recon4p2-1.jpg" alt="Pocket 1 Spawn Locations" title="Recon 2 of 3 (Level 4) - Pocket 1)" /><br />
<br />
<h4>Ambush Spawn 1:</h4>

1x Mercenary Cruise Missile Battery <strong>(Cataclysm Cruise Missile)</strong><br />
2x Mercenary Sentry Gun (Tower Sentry Caldari III)<br />
4x Elite Frigates (Mercenary Wingman) <strong>(Web/Scramble)</strong><br />
3x Cruisers (Mercenary Commander)<br />
2x Battleships (Mercenary Overlord)<br />
<br />
<h4>Ambush Spawn 2:</h4>

1x Mercenary Cruise Missile Battery <strong>(Cataclysm Cruise Missile)</strong><br />
1x Battleships (Mercenary Overlord)<br />
<br />
<h5>Tip:</h5>

<ul><li> To manage aggro, trigger the first ambush by attacking the Mining Corporation Headquarters station.
</li><li> The Mining Corporation Headquarters station drops mainly T1 modules and some Faction ammo. 
</li><li> The mission is flagged completed once you have triggered both spawns i.e. by maneuvering your ship to within 10km of the locked acceleration gate or by destroying the station.</li></ul>
<br />
<h5>Blitz</h5>

<ul><li> Fly to the gate in a shuttle, trigger the ambush, warp out. <strong>Better yet: Use a frigate with a microwarpdrive!</strong> <strong>Better still: use an MJD battleship, align towards the gate and hit the MJD, the mission will complete as soon as you land</strong>
</li><li> Note: The Mercenary Wingman frigates will spawn on top of the warp gate. You may get webbed/scrambled if you're not fast enough in warping out.</li></ul>
<br />
<h5>Mining</h5>

None.<br />
<br />
<h5>Note</h5>

<ul><li> Mining Corporation headquarters has very high HP (approx. 306,550 total).
</li><li> Salvage&Loot about 2mil ISK</li></ul>
<br />
<h5>Bounty</h5>

1.374.990 ISK<br />

<br />
<h1>Recon (3 of 3), Level 4</h1>

<br />
Faction: None<br />
Mission type: Recon<br />
Space type: Deadspace (MWD works)<br />
Damage dealt: All types (EM, Therm, Kin and Exp.)<br />
Web/Scramble: None<br />
Extras: Toxic gas cloud damage<br />
Recommended damage dealing: N/A<br />
Recommended ships: Any well tanked battleship (Raven, Dominix.) or battlecruiser (Drake, Myrmidon, Hurricane.) or a fast cruiser. (Stabber.)<br />
<br />
<h3>Pocket 1</h3>

<br />
There are no NPC ships to kill. The next warp gate is 60km away from the warp-in point. The gate is configured to reject Capsules and Capitals.<br />
<br />
<em>Unconfirmed: Toxic cloud will be disabled upon losing your ship and will not re-enable. <br />
(Confirmed by Dai Verdigris 14Aug2012. Lost a frigate, returned with battleship. No clouds))<br />
(Confirmed by <a class="missingpage" href="./IcareAboutOre.html/edit" title="Create this page">IcareAboutOre</a> 09Dec2013 : Lost a rookie frig, came back in a MWD fitted frig. No cloud, no damage.) <br />
(Falsified by <a class="missingpage" href="./IcareAboutOre.html/edit" title="Create this page">IcareAboutOre</a> 13Dec2013 : Trick did not work. Either they fixed it, or it only works *sometimes*)<br />
(Confirmed by Lelira Cirim 30Dec2013 : Lost a shuttle, came back in a shuttle. No cloud, no damage.)<br />
(Semi-Confirmed by Restrikt 08Feb2014. Lost Frigate, came back in Tengu. Cloud was there and received only one tick of damage) <br />
(How it works: The waves take 4:00, if you warp back shortly after the final wave, they don't reset and you can fly to the gate unmolested.  If you come back too fast they are still going and you can die. If you wait too long they start a new set of waves, or if someone else warps in that would restart it too. The way to do this safely is to start a 4 minute timer as you start to warp, then warp out as soon as you land (about half the time a shuttle can make it out), redock get a new shuttle if needed, be moving the same speed and direction you were last time you warped when the 4 minutes is up, warp in, fly to gate.)<br />
</em><br />
<br />
The toxic environment will damage your ship in consecutive toxic cloud waves. Each wave deals EM, Therm, Kin, and Exp damage. First wave is 500*4=2000 raw damage with no shield/armor resists applied. Each successive wave has increased damage.<br />
<br />
Wave 1	(~2000dmg) 0:15<br />
Wave 2	(~2200dmg) 0:20<br />
Wave 3	(~2400dmg) 0:40<br />
Wave 4	(~2600dmg) 1:00<br />
Wave 5	(~2800dmg) 1:20<br />
Wave 6  (~3000dmg) 1:50<br />
Wave 7	(~3200dmg) 2:10<br />
Wave 8	(~3400dmg) 2:30<br />
Wave 9	(~3600dmg) 2:50<br />
Wave 10	(~3800dmg) 3:10<br />
Wave 11	(~8000dmg) 4:00<br />
<br />
A final giant toxic cloud wave 11 hits after 4:00. It deals 2000 per type = 8000 raw damage with no shield/armor resists applied.<br />
After this final giant toxic cloud there will no more damage coming from the toxic environment. <br />
<br />
<strong><span class="underline">Warning </span></strong><br />
<ul><li> The toxic cloud waves will be reset after you have warped out.
</li><li> DO NOT try to warp to the (plagioclase/pyroxeres) asteroid field in the second pocket. As this is deadspace trying to warp into the second room (using a bookmark) you will land in the first room with the toxic cloud, resulting in a very quick death for any un-prepared mining ship.</li></ul>
<br />
<img src="./screenshots/Recon4p3-1.jpg" alt="Pocket 1 Location At Warp-In" title="Recon 3 of 3 (Level 4) - Pocket 1)" /><br />
<br />
<h4>Toxic Cloud Waves</h4>

500-950 EM damage (at 0% EM resistance.)<br />
500-950 Therm damage (at 0% Therm resistance.)<br />
500-950 Kin damage (at 0% Kin resistance.)<br />
500-950 Exp damage (at 0% Exp resistance.)<br />
<br />
<h4>Final Giant Toxic Cloud (hits after about 10 waves.)</h4>

2000 EM damage (at 0% EM resistance.)<br />
2000 Therm damage (at 0% Therm resistance.)<br />
2000 Kin damage (at 0% Kin resistance.)<br />
2000 Exp damage (at 0% Exp resistance.)<br />
<br />
<h5>Tip:</h5>

<ul><li> Fit an omni-tank to cover for all damage types. Needs a minimum <span class="underline">sustainable</span> 200 dps tank <span class="underline">for each damage type</span>.
</li><li> Fit a microwarpdrive (or afterburner) to quickly cover the distance to the warp gate to save time and if your tank does not meet the minimum requirement.
</li><li> If you're on slow battleship fit a micro jump drive, align to the gate and jump, you'll only have to fly about 15km this way.
</li><li> Stabber setup: Experimental 10MN Microwarpdrive I, Adaptive Invulnerability Field II, 2x Large Shield Extender II, 4x Overdrive Injector. (43sec).
</li><li> Dramiel setup: Limited 1MN Microwarpdrive I, 2x Adaptive Invulnerability Field II, Medium Shield Extender II, 3x Overdrive Injector. (24sec).
</li><li> The mission is flagged completed once you have activated the warp gate and landed in the second room.
</li><li> <span class="strikethrough">You can enter the pocket and approach the gate in a capsule without the clouds spawning. A fleetmate can then warp to you, activate the gate and complete the mission</span>.</li></ul>
<br />
<h5>Mining</h5>

If you can get your Miner though the cloud in the second Pocket, you find:<br />
45 Roids Veldspar = 1382948 Units<br />
30 Roids Plagioclase = 259119 Units<br />
16 Roids Pyroxeres = 139845 Units<br />

Got great satisfaction knowing that the covert ops that scanned me down, most likely an interceptor close behind and one or both of their pods were destroyed when their two buddies' battleships arrived. One of them finally came through to the second room after eight hours. I warped away ;)

As the second gate is 76KM away fromt he warp-in point, this is a Good Thing if you're flying a BS.

<span id="comment_2566"></span>I have never failed to get out of 2/3 easily in the same stabber I have set up for 3/3. I suggest: Open your journal, view your mission, minimize it. Turn on all your brackets and find the warpout you can most easily align with your gate approach. Turn on afterburner and head for your warpout. Get ready to click your warp-to-distance button. When you get near the gate, you'll notice the first spawn pop up. At that point, you can hit your warp button. Before it even finishes kicking in, you'll see the other spawn briefly and your mission complete will display.

<span id="comment_2933"></span>Warning I just did this mission tonight after not getting it for a long time.  Usually on 3 of 3 I just hop in my tristan and using my afterburner fly to the gate rather quickly.  When I entered the mission I was in my pod!<br />
Log shows:<br />

I went back in with a Megathron, grabbed my dropped loot and slow boated it to the gate, total damage taken was 16,204.7!!!<br />

Don't know if this is a fluke or they changed this mission.  Beware.

<span id="comment_2970"></span>Can confirm that sometimes you get scrambled on 2 of 3. Blitz'ed in a shuttle and they got me :P.<br />
<br />
3 of 3 is very easy in a Domi with omni-tank (2x LARII, 1x Thermic Hardener, 1x Kinetic Hardener, 1x Explosive Hardener, 1x EM Hardener and a DCUII). Only one repper is needed so you can fit a 100mn AB to speed it up.<br />
<br />
MrHellcat - the toxic cloud damage doesn't even show in my log. Not sure why, never has for me.

<span id="comment_3100"></span>9/11/09  Pocket 2: Drake split passive set up extremely successful (3x power relays 2x lse2 kin/heat resist amps and kin/heat shield hardeners)<br />
<br />
Dps down the cruisers first to break the dps up on the inc.  Cruise missile tower following that, and then bs.  If your tank can't hang align on warp in and cruise out.  This works only if you attack the station first to get 4 webs instead of scrams.  Low skilled pilots and leave active drones out when you leave and when you warp back in they will have aggro buying you enough time to drop another ship if you are having trouble.  <br />
<br />
Destroying the station is a terrible waste of time.  Terrible loot and mission completion off of shooting it once and then destroying spawn 1.<br />
<br />
Happy hunting.

On 3 I did it in an passive shield ishtar with t2 fit with 1 ab, 1 em amp, rest shield ext.  The damage couldn't break my tank, sat there for a while at the end just to test it.<br />

<span id="comment_3853"></span>I've done this twice in the last week.  For Part 3, I used a Domi, with LAR II, N-Type Hards for Kin, Therm, and Exp, and one ANP II.  Fit an OD II if you think it's necessary, but I use an AB to get to the gate.  I pulse my repper as damage comes in, no need to even run it full out.<br />
<br />
Second time I did it, I made the mistake of not heading towards the gate, when my shield alarm went off, I warped out when I saw what I had done.  After docking to refresh the shield, I came back and slow-boated over, and took not a single point of damage!  The waves evidently go on for so long from your initial warp-in, then stop after the big final wave.  Just warp out, go away for a few minutes, let the waves complete, then come back in, you could do this in a noob frigate (if you warp out quick enough initially, that is)

<div class="comment">
<span id="comment_4285"></span>Based upon my own testing with different hardeners, I believe that the schedule of damage (pre-resistances) is:<br />
<br />
0 seconds: 500 EM, 300 Thermal, 300 Kinetic, 500 Explosive<br />
5 seconds: 2200 perfect omnidamage<br />
25 seconds: 2400 perfect omnidamage<br />
45 seconds: 2600 perfect omnidamage<br />
65 seconds: 2800 perfect omnidamage<br />
95 seconds: 3000 perfect omnidamage<br />
115 seconds: 3200 perfect omnidamage<br />
135 seconds: 3400 perfect omnidamage<br />
155 seconds: 3600 perfect omnidamage<br />
175 seconds: 3800 perfect omnidamage<br />
225 seconds: 8000 perfect omnidamage<br />
<br />
By &quot;perfect omnidamage&quot;, I mean 25% EM, 25% Thermal, 25% Kinetic, and 25% Explosive.<br />
<br />
Total pre-resistance damage is 36,600 hitpoints if you stay for the final wave.<br />
<br />
As with Recon Level 2, the wave at 5 seconds doesn't always appear.  My Dominix observed it (1 test to measure if it was safe to use a Drake), my Drake has never seen it (used for the resistance measurements; 5 tests).  Unlike Recon Level 2, most of the waves are perfect omnidamage, and it's even less worthwhile to try to optimize against one kind of damage.

I warped in with a Caracal (was too hard), so i warped out again, getting my Megathron.  After ~ 5min i warped back in again. I approached the gate without beeing hit at any time. Neither the 20s Waves, nor the &quot;big&quot; waves are triggered.<br />
<br />
Can anybody confirm such an Experience?<br />
<br />
Try the following:<br />
 - Warp in<br />
 - Warp out after first hit<br />
 - Wait 5 min,<br />
 - Then try it with SAME ship, if you are still beeing hit, try another ship...

<br />
Warping to your bookmark gets you back to the beacon. Warping to your bookmark @ 50km puts you very close to the acc gate.<br />
<br />
Also i can confirm my experience: The Waves aren't triggered with second warp in anymore... (Just the big one after 20 secs - if i would have waited longer, maybe it wouldnt, too....)<br />

<span id="comment_4715"></span>They must have changed this mission recently, as I used to run Part 3 in a fast shield tanked assault frigate, and I'd always get out with a little armor damage. I just lost a Jaguar fitted with a Med Shield Ext II, damage control, and anti-EM and anti-Kin rigs.<br />
<br />
I went back in with a Stabber fitted as the OP suggested with two Large Shield Extenders, AB, and 3 overdrive injectors in the lows, and got destroyed as I was trying to warp out and still 10 km from the gate.<br />
<br />
I don't remember this mission being so hard in the past. Beware!<br />
<br />
I was able to do it with my Maelstrom battleship, which has an X-Large Shield booster and multiple hardeners and Shield Boost Amps. The only scary part was the last toxic damage hit, which took my shields to 50%. Then I was able to rep the shields and salvage my previous two ships. :(

Pseudoelectron Containment Field I<br />

<br />
My base shield/armor/hull hitpoints were 548/2137/1273.<br />
My base EM/Th/Kin/Exp resistances (without the field on) were 58/60/85/50 shield and 50/68/84/40 armor.<br />
<br />
Switched the containment field on as I was arriving at the warp-in point. The initial wave at 0s took out my shield, the waves at 5s and 25s reduced my armor to 26% as I was MWDing towards the acceleration gate. Warped out long before the wave at 45s could hit (would still survive it, though).<br />
<br />
The reward for Part 3 (standing increase, ISK, and LP) is rather unappealing compared to how much you get for the previous two parts, especially for Part 1...

<span id="comment_7979"></span>Trick under &quot;How it works&quot; worked for me first time.  Started timer as soon as I clicked &quot;Warp to location.&quot;  Warped back as soon as I landed.  Waited....  Clicked &quot;Warp to location&quot; exactly 4 min later.  Cruised to gate...  no damage at all.  Not sure when the waves would restart, but I was flying a 2800 m/s frigate, so I wasn't there all that long.

<span id="comment_8038"></span>Okay, the &quot;trick&quot; didn't work as well this time.  I got crushed as soon as I landed on grid and didn't have time to warp out to wait out the timer.  I used a insta undock this time, which I don't believe I did before.  So, that may have made the difference.  Use a shuttle for this...
