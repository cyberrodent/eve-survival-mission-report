<br />
<h3>Single Pocket</h3>

<br />
Auto aggro at warp-in. All ships & sentry guns are within 20km.<br />
<br />
<h4>Single Group:</h4>

3x Elite Frigates (Mercenary Wingman)  <strong>Web/Scramble</strong> <strong>Piranha Light Missile</strong><br />
3x Cruisers (Mercenary Commander) <strong>Scourge Heavy Missile</strong><br />
2x Battleships (Mercenary Overlord) <strong>Scourge Heavy Missile</strong><br />

<h5>Structures</h5>

Abandoned Stargate - Drops Metal Scraps (50)<br />
<br />
<h5>Tip</h5>

<ul><li> Ratah Niaga has a very high resistance to thermal damage. Use kinetic damage to kill him.
</li><li> Ratah Niaga has a speed of 145 m/s and will try to orbit at a distance of 250km. You may kill him first before he gets away OR refit to include an MWD if killing him last.
</li><li> Ratah Niaga can be easily killed last, if you fit a fast ship with cloak and jettison something next to him to warp to. Then change to your damage ship, warp to him and kill the bastard.
</li><li> All the named battleship bosses have a small chance to drop faction loot.
</li><li> Mission is *not* flagged complete after you kill the named battleship boss. You must eliminate all ships.</li></ul>

<span id="comment_677"></span>Using an armor tanked 'Phoon I used 1xEM and 2xKin hardeners (my ship has an anti-explosive rig).<br />
<br />
The best way to deal with this mission is to be able to take all the aggro right away and take out Ratah Niaga, if you don't he will run as indicated.  If you can't handle all that DPS the alternative is to warp in at 70km (you will be outside of Niaga's precision cruise range) and pick off the support ships.<br />
<br />
Then, either warp out and back in to the beacon where you are closer to him or get a friend with a webber to slow him down.  He has a tough shield tank and is weakest to Kinetic, you're going to need a lot of DPS to take him down though -- solo with a 'Phoon you'll need Wasps and 1200mm Arties, Wrath Furies could help if you have skills to use them.  Otherwise you'll need to warp out and go with torps (webber friend required).

<span id="comment_1028"></span>I dared to warp to 0 with a Mael w/ 5 power diags, X-large shield booster, invul, 2 magnetic resist amps, 1 each heat and kin resist amp (all mods T2), and CCC I rigs. Bad idea. DPS was enormous.<br />
<br />
Warped out and back in at 100 km though (warp-in trick works), piece of cake. Didn't need any MWD or AB as I got Tauron as named BS.

<span id="comment_1520"></span>Did this in a Drake, had to warp out the first time because of heavy DPS. I had 2x T2 passive shield hardeners, one tT2 thermal and a T2 invulnerabilty. Went back with 2x kinetic and 1 Thermal and worked pretty good, only loss 50% shields. Did not have a problem with any of the mission rats, they all closed within 10km from me with Tauron having a webbie on him. Had 7x Heavy launcher II's with EM rage worked really well and took out all the rats in less than 10 minutes.

<span id="comment_1547"></span>Initial DPS is above average but nothing scary. But if you lock onto the named rat, in my case Taisu Magdesh in a Raven, they go down pretty quickly.<br />
<br />
Setup as follows - Hyperion: 8 x Neutron Blaster Cannon II (Antimatter), 4 x CAP Recharger II, 1 x AFB, 1 x Large Rep II, 1 x Kin Hardener, 4 x Energized Adaptive Hardener II (RIGS: 2 x CCC, 1 x ANP)<br />
<br />
No nice loot... :(

<span id="comment_1807"></span>used a Raven; T2 cruise launchers and BCS, ordinary T1 Wrath missiles, and a signal booster to increase lock range to 110km+.  came in at 100km and easily killed the Cruisers and Battleships while drones ate the webbers.  Returned at short range for the sentry guns.  Ratah was running, but I warped in for 3rd time at the mission's zero point and he wasn't far enough away (only 75km) -- didn't need an AB or MWD.  One EM and two Therm T1 hardeners plus two Large T1 shield expanders and Target Painter.

Dual Pithi A-type Vargur with 1x SBAII 2x invuln IIs got to 50% shields in the 5 km it took to kill the named BS, but otherwise a 5 minute mission

<br />
Used a 6-slot tank (XLSBII, SBAI, ThermIIx2, EMII, InvulnII) with 6 cap flux II in the lows and 800mm auto IIs in the highs. Tank nearly stable with initial aggro (Tauron), totally stable after sentries died.<br />
<br />
Time to completion: ~ 10 minutes while my drones mopped up the frigates and my alt salvaged.

Warped in at 100km. Insta aggro from mercs. Killed wingmen with Warrior II's.<br />
Kited away until beyond sentry range. Slowed and killed BC's and BS's with Proton L, Cataclysm Cruise and ValkyrieII at range. Now only Ratah Niaga and sentries remain at warp distance. Warped to sentry (boss at 50km) and AB'd towards him while pummelling with Wrath Cruise/Proton/Valks. No faction loot.

I wasn't well hardened against Thermal, so initial DPS was very high. I lost 20000 shields in 75 seconds and warped/wimped out. But I came right back with the same fit at 100km and wasted them effortlessly. <br />
Widowmaker heavy missiles did 3x more damage than Scourge. Lousy loot.<br />
Tauron webbed me down to something like 18m/s.

- *Don't lock* but go towards the boss<br />

Important bits are to kill the sentries and webbing frigates fast (use T2 drones) and to have a good shield.

<span id="comment_4889"></span>Edits to the above:<br />
- you send drones at the same time while killing the sentries of corse<br />
- I did not need to use any AB or MWD because the boss did not make in time to get away, so it's possible to drop it and place a kin hardener for a much easier mission. The initial DPS is indeed somewhat scary, expecially if you let the webs slow you down to a crawl.

MAR2 (complex version is likely less stressful), 1 each type energized membrane 2, EANM 2; AB2, TC2 with both scripts ready, 3X recharger 2;, railguns of your choice with tungsten and antimatter in the cargo bay; 5XHam2s. Warp in at 70 or 100km, head directly away from the mercs, who will chase, then pick them off from small to large. After the last BS, chase the named target. Leave the sentry guns until last. L4s in BCs aren't everybody's thing but they are fun while you're saving for a BS.
