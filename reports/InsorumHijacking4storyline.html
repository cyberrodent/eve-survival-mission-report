Faction: Minmatar Republic<br />
Mission type: Encounter <br />
Space type: Deadspace<br />
Damage dealt: Explosive/EM<br />
Extras: Target Painting (Kvarm, Ymir)<br />
Web/scramble: None<br />
Recommended damage dealing: Explosive/Kinetic<br />
Recommended ship class: Battleship<br />
Recommended generic setup: Close Combat, Heavy Tank<br />
<br />
Special Ship Restrictions: Only Shuttle through Battleship sized ships<br />
Required Equipment: Salvager required to access objective<br />
<br />
<h3>Single Pocket</h3>

<br />
<h4>Group 1 (45-55km, No Aggro)</h4>

4x Elite Frigates (Chief Republic Kvarm) <strong>Target Painting</strong><br />
4x Elite Cruisers (Chief Republic Rodul/Manadis)<br />
6x Battleships (Republic Tribal Jotun/Jarl Republic Jotun/Jarl)<br />
<ul><li> All surround 6 Wrecks and 1 Container <strong>Objective</strong>
</li><li> All orbit under 10km, except Manadis (22km)
</li><li> Any one of the Cruisers can trigger Group 2
</li><li> Any one of the Battleships can trigger Group 3</li></ul>
<br />
<h4>Group 2 (Auto Aggro)</h4>

5x Battleships (Republic Ymir/Sigur) <strong>Ymir Target Painting</strong><br />
<ul><li> Sigur orbit under 10km, Ymir at about 35km</li></ul>
<br />
<div class="indent"></div>
<h4>Group 3 (Auto Aggro)</h4>

5x Battleships (Republic Tribal Jotun)<br />
<br />
<h5>Blitz</h5>

Randomly possible. If all ships are dead, even if last killed triggers another wave, it completes.<br />
Easiest method is kill Frigates in Group 1, Cruisers, Group 2, then Group 1 BS's and hope trigger is the last.<br />
<br />
<h5>Mineable Asteroids</h5>

None<br />
<br />
<h5>Structures</h5>

None<br />
<br />
<h5>Tips</h5>

<ul><li> No aggro at warp in, idle drones do not draw aggro
</li><li> Kill frigates first as they target paint, increasing damage done to you
</li><li> Leaving and returning after spawning waves will reset aggro on Group 1
</li><li> Can then attack spawned waves without drawing aggro from Group 1
</li><li> Using drones on spawned waves after returning draws aggro from Group 1
</li><li> Rumor of Group 4 (5x Frigates, Chief Republic Gleeda)
</li><li> Remember to have the Insorum Components with you for turn in
</li><li> Maximum possible mission standing gain for completion
</li></ul>

<span id="comment_883"></span>I just did this with a CNR tanked against Exp and Kin. I had to warp out 3 times! The last time I checked the log and noticed that the turrets did way too much damage, maybe thermal damage?<br />
<br />
The correct wreck appears as container in overview, it must be salvaged. When the salvaging is done, open the container and take the item.

<span id="comment_887"></span>I don't have accurate enough information yet to Edit the page but I think some of the report is inaccurate and/or missing. Next time I'll bring my alt in his Paladin and share the tanking so I have more freedom to watch closely.<br />
<br />
1. The spawns are not timed. They are triggered by the death of a particular rat.<br />
2. &quot;Spawns&quot; were not as reported due to killing rats in different trigger sequence than the reporter.<br />
3. Initial spawn appears to be one group for agro purposes.<br />
4. AC or other short range fast tracking turret is highly recommended over long range.<br />
5. A partial blitz is possible as the Mission Completion is not triggered by the last rat killed rather by a particular rat which should be identifiable with more careful reporting than I was doing.

<span id="comment_909"></span>Just did this mission in a Nighthawk.  Second spawn seemed to be timed, and last spawn came after all the battleships were destroyed.  I came back to this mission with a dedicated salvager, as it was an excellent mission to salvage/loot with 15+ battleships.<br />
<br />
I didn't have to warp out, but definitely take out the first wave of target painters first.  By the time the second wave arrived, I had killed enough of the battleships to sustain shield tank even while being painted.

<span id="comment_921"></span>It appears that if you kill the initial group that you started with, you may most likely be able to blitz this. Otherwise the mission is not complete. I do know, though, that not all BS's need to be killed in order to have the mission complete. I would recommend being very careful and take out the BS's first as they give the highest damage in a domi. Try to fan out your approach though. BS spawning tends to happen when the last one of a group name is destroyed. I would not recommend blitzing in the setup mentioned below. Also, BS's do not give bounties.<br />
<br />
I did this mission in a domi with an EM and therm rig, and 3 explosion hardeners and a kinetic hardener, as well as a damage control and 2 LAR II's. Middle is full of cap rechargers and high is with 2 heavy Nos's and a smartbomb and whatever else you want to fit on it. Used t1 heavy berserkers, drone aggro is fine (from what I can tell) as long as you first get aggro. Hope this helps!

<div class="comment">
<span id="comment_948"></span>I completed the mission without any warp outs in a Raven with 2x invuls, 2x boost amps and 1 xl booster.<br />
<br />
Tactics were like this:<br />
kill the painting frigates<br />
kill the 2x Republic Tribal Jotun<br />
1x Republic Jotun<br />
(cruisers should all be alive still)<br />
kill the 2xRepublic Jarl then kill the 4xfrigates that spawn<br />
kill the Republic Tribal Jarl (it will be the last BS at this point), then kill the 5 BS it spawns.<br />
kill the cruisers, at some point 5 more BS will spawn so kill them.<br />
<br />
with this approach you are tanking a max of 5 BS at one time which is quite managable.

 I had already killed the Chief Republic Gleeda, so these might also aggro. Someone confirm.<br />
 After destroying the Sigur, I reaggroed the entire pocket by firing on the remaining ships.<br />

<br />
I used an Abaddon with 1x LARII, 2x Explosive, 1x Thermic, 1x Kinetic hardeners.  I dropped to 35% armor at one point, but never had to warp out.  For gunners, I recommend short-range weapons over long-range, as most ships close to within 10km if you let them.

I don't believe the warp out/in comment on the 5 BS spawn is correct.  Maybe that person was running so the main ships were far from spawn.  For me warping out/in caused a normal re-agro of the pocket.

<div class="comment">
<span id="comment_2927"></span>-Tanked very successfully in a passive CNR with t2 Inv Field, Exp, Kin, Therm; DC, 2x BCS. Should probably have lost the DC for another BCS. Used some faction missiles on Battleships. Drones: 4x Warrior, 3x Valkyrie, TP-900. An EM hole in resists seemed to cause no problems whatsoever.<br />
-Drones patiently went through the frigates quickly enough. TP-900 helped speed up the final Cruisers and gave a more reasonable option had I wanted to use cruise missiles on frigates. Did not encounter a cruiser trigger.<br />
-You cannot use a MWD (on a salvager) before turn-in. Convoy wreck cannot be tractored; it is the mission goal--salvage it, then open and take contents.<br />
-Mission didn't trash Minmatar standings too badly. Full salvage/loot will fit in a Catalyst, barely.

Only had to warp out once, because I was low on cap and didn't have the right ammo loaded. This warpout occured at the Sigur and Ymir spawn, didn't have Javelins loaded to take them out.

<span id="comment_4194"></span>I didn't realize how long this mission would take to run, I started it 3 hours before server down.  When the server came back up, I had to restart the entire mission.  When I ran it the second time, I salvaged the target ships after killing all of the initial spawn except the 4 cruisers and the Republic Tribal Jarl.  I then killed the Tribal Jarl and got the 5 BS spawn.  I then killed the 4 cruisers and the mission flagged as complete without the last 5 BS Spawn.  Don't know if this was due to server down or because I salvaged the target wreck.  (I did lose the asteroid field during server down).<br />
<br />
Completed it in a T1 Drake with 7 Malkuth Heavy Missiles, 2 Shield Amps, 1 Lg Shield Booster, 1 Lg Shield Extender, 1 10M ABurner, 2 Ballistic Controls, 1 Cap Recharger, and about 2000 Scourge Hvy Missiles.

<span id="comment_4283"></span>I got this mission again, and this time after triggering the first 5 BS spawn, from the Republic Trial Jarl, I brought my salvage alt in to grab the mission item while my main blew stuff up. Later when I cleared out the group of cruisers they did NOT cause a second 5 BS group to spawn. I'm not sure if this was because the mission item had already been looted or not, but it might be a blitz if it can be confirmed.

<span id="comment_4757"></span>Like ClayShaw I completed this in a Drake without too much issue. Despite the number of BS's, tank is very possible from the Drake. Your DPS will be quite slow though. Keep the frigs as the primary targets while up, no exceptions. Otherwise the TenkTenk method works great.<br />

For reference:  2xLSE II, 2xKINAmp II, 2xEXPAmp II, 3xSPR II, 3xPurger I's, moderate skills.

<br />
Did this in a CNS(corpion), no problems with 10 cap booster charges (800s). Sigur and its elite form does very high turret damage indeed (as someone mentioned above), so focus those down before commencing with other battleships.<br />
<br />
This mission gives maximum standing reward, very nice boost to faction standing indeed. Also loot and salvage are awesome. <br />
Funnily, there are several Caldari wrecks so you can loot and salvage them, too.

<span id="comment_5530"></span>Completed in T1 fitted Drake. The damage dealt in this mission was certainly not EXP/EM, more like EXP/THERM, though there may have been some EM/KIN in there too I'm not sure. Took out the frigates and then the 6 BS. When the next 6 BS spawned I had to warp out because of the heavy thermal damage, but came back with thermal resists and finished them off. There was zero EM damage from these guys. No second spawn after killing the cruisers either.<br />
<br />
P.S the NPC database for these ships is not accurate as there were no EM missiles from any of the ships I encountered

As i have been farming this for a few days it seems random between the 4 additional frigates or 5 addtional Battleships.<br />
<br />
Very profitable mission to farm. Simply avoid killing one of the initial frigates, kill everything else, warp back in a salvager capable of tanking a single elite frigate. Repeat daily untill mission expiry date. This works great as its also a storyline so it wont cut into running your normal agents missions.<br />
<br />
Note: Caldari tags are no longer contraband.
