<br />
Faction: Amarr<br />
Mission type: Encounter<br />
Space type: Deadspace<br />
Damage dealt: EM/Thermal/Kinetic (Jakar)<br />
Web/scramble: web from Imperial Guards<br />
Recommended damage dealing: EM/Thermal<br />
Recommended ships: Paladin, Golem, CNR, Raven, Domi<br />
<br />
One "Imperial Navy Gate Permit" is required or you can't activate the gate. You obtain it as soon as complete Part 3 of this chain. Several ships can use the gate after the first ship with the permit has unlocked it.<br />
<br />
<h3>Pocket 1</h3>

<br />
<h4>Left Group (20-25 km)</h4>

3x Battleships (Imperial Security Captain)<br />
-1x Amarr Navy Apocalypse<br />
-2x Amarr Navy Armageddon<br />
5x Frigates (Imperial Guard)<br />
-1x Amarr Navy Delta II Support Frigate<br />
-4x Amarr Navy Gamma I Support Frigate<br />
<br />
<h4>Middle Group (16-23 km)</h4>

3x Battleships<br />
-1x Imperial Security Commander (Amarr Navy Jakar)<br />
-2x imperial security captain (Amarr Navy Apocalypse)<br />
<br />
3x Cruisers<br />
-3x Imperial Security Officers (Amarr Navy Maller)<br />
<br />
<h4>Right Group (28-34 km)</h4>

3x Battleships (Imperial Security Captain)<br />
-1x Amarr Navy Apocalypse<br />
-2x Amarr Navy Armageddons<br />
5x Frigates (Imperial Guard)<br />
-1x Amarr Navy Delta II Support Frigate<br />
-4x Amarr Navy Gamma I Support Frigate<br />
<br />
Attack the middle group first as it aggroes separately. Aggroing the left or right groups will also aggro the middle group. The middle group will not aggro if you move a minimum of about 40km away.<br />
<br />
No loot from structures.  The NPCs drop lots of loot though.<br />
<br />
<h3>Pocket 2</h3>

<br />
3x Amarr Sentry Guns (40-45 km)<br />
1x Imperial Stargate<br />
2x Cruisers (35-45 km)<br />
-2x Divine Imperial Equalizer<br />
1x Battleship (35-45 km)<br />
- 1x Imperial Ultara<br />
<br />
Your agent contacts you and orders you to destroy the Stargate before reinforcements arrive. Reports from a few other pilots suggest that these reinforcements dont spawn even after waiting for 2-3 hours. However be on your guard as the composition of these "reinforcements" are unknown and may be on a random timer.<br />
<br />
The stargate has roughly 250.000 HP, so be sure bring maximum damage ammo and drones (the gate has 0 resists). <br />
<br />
The first respawn appears relatively quickly and may already be present at warp in:<br />
<br />
5x frigates (warp scram) (these were not present when entering with a Battlecruiser, or Command Ship)<br />
2x divine imperial<br />
2x imperial templar<br />
2x Battleship (Imperial Ultara)<br />
3x amarr sentry gun<br />
<br />
<h5>Tips</h5>

<br />
In pocket 1, the Imperial Guard frigates approach fast making them difficult to snipe from far away. Bring small drones to take out the frigates, which will web you. The Imperial Security Commanders (Amarr Navy Jakar BS) have a significantly stronger tank than the Imperial Security Captains (Amarr Navy Apocalypse BS).<br />
<br />
In pocket 2, remember to kill the warp scramblers. If you lose your ship you cannot get back to loot it (unless you buy another Permit on contract). Damage is not overwhelming if you got an adequate tank (doable in passive tanked Drake)<br />
<br />
Another respawn from Ixtelle:<br />
<br />
Approx 1hr after I entered the pocket (just as I was finishing looting it), 5x Imperial Avengers and 1x Imperial Equalizer respawned in the pocket.<br />
<br />
Then two imperial templar torahs appeared about 18 minutes into the mission.<br />
<br />
I believe I have seen the initial rats before on this mission but this was definitely the first time I ever saw the torahs come in during the mission.<br />
<br />
Teiresias adds: There may be some variation in the mission drones here, rather than Imperial Dominator, i got Imperial Ultara. (Armageddon NPC) For the 18 minute respawn there are two Imperial Templar Ultara (not Torah)<br />
<br />
Tip from Ixtelle:<br />
Use EM Torps. The BS's have very strong tanks. Recommend EM Drones if only for the Divine Imperial Equalizers.<br />
The stargate took about half as many torps to kill as the guide said (I had fired 186 when it blew, so probably 180 to kill it. Each torp did 558 damage, so that's about 100k HP + whatever my drones did, I estimate 150k hp absolute maximum. <br />
<br />
<br />
<span class="underline">Standing loss:</span><br />
2.4% loss with the Amarr Empire per standing tick (15 minutes).<br />
<br />
<span class="underline">Tags to be looted:</span><br />
<br />
<br />
Imperial Navy Colonol I x 9<br />
Imperial Navy General I x 5<br />
Imperial Navy General II x 5<br />
Imperial Navy Sergeant II x 9<br />
Imperial Navy Sergeant III x 1<br />

<span id="comment_390"></span>Middle - Right - Left seemed to do well for me. Attacking one group didn't uprouse the others and neither did my drones. Maybe it was the distance i first gained. (&gt;80km)<br />
<br />
The first gate opens only to the preliminarily gathered Imperial Navy Gate Permit. This tends to get a bit intricate when salvaging in tandem, but thankfully the gate seems to have a 10s access timer, similarly to AE bonus. (every mission should have such a lock at the entrance imho)<br />
<br />
I can confirm two Imperial Templar Torah's while bringing down the stargate. They took a while to destroy though.

<span id="comment_959"></span>i ran this in a myrmidon shield tanked, only took about 10 mins to kill the gate with 2 heavy 2 medium and 1 light drone from it...<br />
<br />
also i went straight ramming speed into the middle group in the first pocket with my drones out and eventually i had all aggro on my ship without moving anywhere so i think the drones drew aggro onto my ship instead of themselves

<span id="comment_1063"></span>Ran this in armor tanking Ishtar.<br />
Only thing that was hard in this mission for me was to get full-agro in the first pocket in order to be safely able to deploy ogres. <br />
Also it's good to have some light drones to deploy on those Support frigates if the get on you (5x web is quite bad for Ishtar).
