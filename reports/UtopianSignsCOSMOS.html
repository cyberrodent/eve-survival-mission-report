<h3>Utopian Signs - Radio Sociologist (1 of 3)</h3>

<br />
<strong>Background</strong>:Why, hello to you stranger. It's good to see a friendly face out here. Or at least someone not shooting at me. I'm Dr. Tikrest, by the way. Some call me Ramakell, but I prefer to be called the Professor. In case you haven't heard of my work, I'm a renown sociologist.<br />
<br />
So, what is a famous and handsome sociologist such as me doing out here in the middle of nowhere, you might be asking yourself? I don't want to befuddle you with all the technical terminology of my trade, so let me put it simply. I have a reason to believe that a mysterious human civilization lived here in the Ani constellation thousands and thousands of years ago. Yes! I know it's hard to believe, but a famous and intelligent person such as me wouldn't make such a claim unless I was absolutely sure. A few of my more narrow-minded colleagues have scorned this idea of mine, so I'm out here to prove them wrong.<br />
<br />
What I'm going to do is build an immense radio antenna capable of detecting the most miniscule signals from deep space. My theory is that such a powerful civilization as this one presumably was must have used some pretty powerful communication devices. Well, there still might be some fractions of signals left out there floating in space, waiting for someone renown and brilliant like me to pick them up.<br />
<br />
Unfortunately, my work hasn't launched under the most auspicious of portents. On my very first day out here, I was set upon by a brigand of the most obnoxious and foul-mouthed nature. Neither my illustrious career nor my most eloquent rhetoric sufficed to fend him off and he took off with my portable power generator. The scoundrel was flying a frigate, but he might be anywhere in the constellation by now. Damn Angels! What is the world coming to when renown and charming sociologists like me can't go about their business without having some young punks and upstarts harassing them? Not to mention making lout and insidious remarks that are totally unfounded. The nerve of these pirates! Well, I wont stand for it. I'm not only renown, but also wealthy. I'll pay you good money for hunting down that punk and bring me back my portable power generator. <br />

<h3>Utopian Signs - Antenna in the Sky (2 of 3)</h3>

<br />
<strong>Background</strong>: Allow me to congratulate you once more on retrieving that power generator for me. It is invaluable for my work here. Your efficiency might almost suffice to make you a passable sociologist one day. But enough about that.<br />
<br />
As I've already explained to you, I need to build an immense antenna to have any hope of catching a glimpse into past. To my frustration, the pitiful antennas available on the market are nowhere near being sufficient to meet my needs. But a renown and resourceful sociologist like me doesn't let a little fact like that stop him. I've already placed an order with the firm Boundless Creations for them to custom make an antenna for me. It is being built at their factory over in the Hek system. Their work has progressed at an admiring rate, but they refuse to deliver it to me here. So I'm in need of a courier to fetch me my antenna. Of course, a renown and respected person such as myself can't be bothered with such a trivial matter. But if you are interested, I will give you good money. I've learnt that when dealing with independent pilots such as yourself, money will convince people to do most anything.<br />

<h3>Utopian Signs - Navy Issue Amplifier (3 of 3)</h3>

<br />
<strong>Background</strong>: This is all coming together nicely, I must say. We have accomplished much, you and me, and now we're on the brink of success that might change the world of sociology forever. Doesn't it brighten your otherwise mundane existence to be a part, albeit a small one, in something as great as this? No need to thank me though, for a renown and modest sociologist such as me, fame and success is all it takes to fuel what little vanity I have.<br />
<br />
But we're not quite there yet. I'm still in need of a good signal amplifier to work alongside my new antenna. The one I brought was nowhere near up to the task and literally melted when I started feeding it the signals from the antenna. Luckily, one of my former students is in the Republic Fleet and is stationed here in Ani. It's sad really, he's very talented and had a brilliant and cozy career in sociology ahead of him. But no, he had to play the hero and go join the military, the fool.<br />
<br />
Well, his loss is my gain now. I heard from him that after one of the many unsuccessful Republic invasions into the contested complex in Traun, he noticed one of his fallen comrades leaving behind a Republic amplifier. With a little bit of modification, that piece of equipment would be perfect for my purposes. If you hurry you might be able to get a hold of the amplifier before someone else scoops it up. I don't know where it is exactly, but I gather from my ex-student that they were trying to force their way into the inner-most room of the complex when they beat a retreat. So have a look around that area. History waits for no man, renown sociologists or not, so to entice you into putting a step on it I'll offer you a solid BPC as a reward for a job well done.<br />
<br />
This is an important mission, which will have significant impact on your faction standings.<br />
