<h3>Single Pocket</h3>

<br />
6 waves of Republic Fleet ships that warp-in at 4-minute intervals.  The first wave (on warp-in) may be split into two groups with the 2nd group warping in shortly after the 1st.<br />
<br />

2x Battleship (1x Republic Fleet Tempest, 1x Republic Fleet Typhoon)<br />
<br />
<h5>Wave 1 DPS</h5>

0 EM + 467 EX + 327 KN + 25 TH<br />
= 819dps<br />
<br />

3x Battleship (Republic Fleet Darkana)<br />
<br />
<h5>Final wave DPS</h5>

183 EM, 205 EX, 64 KN, 0 TH<br />

<br />
<strong>Mission Total DPS (EM,EX,KN,TH) = 505, 1502, 789, 305<br />
= 3101dps</strong><br />
<br />
Only the Stargate drops loot (standard commodities and some contraband)<br />
Don't forget to destroy the Stargate before warping back to your agent! (<strong>Note:</strong> Stargate has very high HP)<br />
A Bunker and Heavy Missile Battery will hit you with -2.4% faction hit if you destroy them.  Only needed hit is -0.02% that occurs with 1 of the Republic Fleet Typhoons<br />
<br />
<span class="underline">Tags to be looted:</span><br />
<br />
Republic Fleet Captain I x 4<br />
Republic Fleet Commander I x 5<br />

Republic Fleet High Captain I x 6<br />
Republic Fleet Private III x 9<br />
Republic Fleet Private V x 3<br />
<br />
<span class="underline">Standings:</span><br />
-2.4% for killing Republic Fleet Officer and -2.4% for destroying the stargate. (2 standing ticks for me, waiting for all spawns to show before blowing up the stargate).<br />

<span id="comment_35"></span>This is one of the toughest Level 4 missions you'll deal with, simply because of the relative quickness that each wave warps in.  If you ever need to warp out, you'll either have to come back with a few wingmates, or wait until the mission resets after downtime.  The trick is to balance your tank and your firepower so that you don't get swamped.  The RF Darkanas and the Freedom Patriots should be priority once they pop-up.  The Darkanas fire high-damage Mojlnir (EM) torpedoes, and the Patriots use lasers.  My Maelstrom's setup consisted of:<br />
<br />
HI &gt; 8x T2 1400mm Artillery (Phased Plasma &amp; Fusion)<br />
MID &gt; LSB II, T2 SB Amp, 2x T2 Invuln. Fields, 1x T2 EM hardener, 1x T2 EX hardener<br />
LO &gt; 3x T2 Gyros, 2x Cap Fluxes<br />
RIGS &gt; 3x CCC<br />
DRONES &gt; 5x Hammerhead II's, 5x Valkyrie II's<br />
<br />
The setup gave me 550-600dps and a 516dps tank.

<span id="comment_47"></span>Just as a note on that thread, and the original version of this mission that was reported.  I actually timed the frequency that the waves warp-in, and it is 4 minutes between each.  The guide does seem to be fairly accurate, but some of the steps should be taken with a grain of salt because I've done the work of letting you know what you're up against.  With the 550-600dps I was putting out (artilleries on BS's and BC's, drones on Cruisers and smaller), I was clearing each wave probably within 3 minutes.  The best advice I can give, is focus on the NPC's and leave the stargate for last as it does NO damage to you and it goes down quicker if you can put all your firepower on it.  I've recently found a way to increase my tank by 20% at the expense of only 10dps off my output, I haven't had a chance to test it out though.

<span id="comment_60"></span>Nabar Phargal about the mission:<br />
<br />
I burned away from the spawns as long as my tank held with one rep and lined them up for my T2 ogres When doing this none of the spawns started closer than 100km away. They all targeted me, never aggro'd drones. Managed to kill the first darkana between the 3rd and 4th spawn. Had to leave 2nd repper on and burst AB when last spawn came in. Saved the rest of the Darkana for last. I used T1 Berserkers on the Darkanas.<br />
<br />
Tig about the mission:<br />
<br />
I warp allined and started kiting spawns, killed cruisers and BS let hammerheads kill frigs switched to ogre for BS. The major problem for me was the darkana. Very good tanks with mjolir torpedoes. Also watch for Freedom liberty with cataclysm cruise missles.

<span id="comment_61"></span>I've done this mission solo some times with my CNR. I use a permaboost setup, with only 2 hardeners, only 10 EM resist from my booster alt.<br />
<br />
I allign to something, killing everything except the Darkanaa, cause they aren't in range anyway, and I have to switch ammo to be able to kill them cause of their strong tank (Exp works best against them).<br />
<br />
When everything else is killed except Darkanaa, I switch to Exp and kill them, and only a few of them are in range to hit me. If I do something wrong and get too many in range to hit me, I have to warp out and fit 2 EM hardeners.

<span id="comment_396"></span>Cruicial point was between the fourth and fifth spawn. I used a CNR with 4 BCS and Navy Missiles. The fifth spawn was the first to come in before the whole preceding spawn had been eliminated. I switched ammo to explosive for all Darkanas and used thermal for the others.

<span id="comment_884"></span>Just done this for the first time. Some advice for raven/CNR pilots:<br />
<br />
I managed it solo in a T2 fit CNR (Invul, Exp &amp; Kin hardner and DCU) but it was touch and go for a bit. Aligning as soon as you get in is a must but it took me out of range for some spawns causing me to waste time getting to them.<br />
<br />
Take out the darkana's as soon as they appear except the final spawn cause the EM torps raped my tank.<br />
<br />
Good luck o/

<span id="comment_904"></span>I just completed this in a perma-rep raven (t2 fitted) without too many problems, I was nervous because of some of the other comments written. My strategy was quite simple, after entering I aligned back away from the structures...<br />
<br />
On each wave I killed anything that could tackle first, (support frigates) these insta-pop if you hit them while they are mwd'ing with a volley of cruise (otherwize they are a pain to kill).<br />
<br />
My fit was a T2 X-L rep/2xboost amps/2x Invul I never went below 100% shield but I never had more than 5 BS within 60km from me.

Apocalypse<br />
8x Mega Modulated Energy Beam, 4x Cap Recharger II, 2 LAR II, 1 EANM II, 1 Armor hardener II of each type. 3xCCC<br />
Would suggest explosive drones if you decide to go with an ammarian ship due to their lack of exp weapons for the darkana. I left all the darkana for the end and then refit with Heat Sinks for more damage.

<span id="comment_1259"></span>Another thing about the Darkana's is their Remote Shield Repper. I left all Darkana's for last and in a Nighthawk, I had a tough time breaking their Tank. Once the first one goes down, it was smooth sailing though I still had to expend a lot more ammo than intended.<br />
<br />
Killing Darkana's should be  priority

<span id="comment_1523"></span>Had this series again, and tried this in a Hyperion. Tanked with an active Explosive T2 hardener, Single Large Rep T2 (Hyp gets a Rep bonus for Gal BS skill), and EANM2 in other slots, Rigs were 2 x CCC, and a ANP. Mids, All Cap Recharger II. Tanked fine. Used Sentries to take out anything close and had 425mm t2 Large Hybrids to take out everything at Range. Switched between Lead and Antimatter Ammo depending on range of targets. Was able to take out everything very quickly and did not have a problem getting swamped. Tank was stable at approx 80-85% armour.<br />
<br />
I sat and targeted the most powerful ship with my own guns and the closest for my sentries. I didn't move from the warp-in point.<br />
<br />
Also none of the frigs scrammed me, they only webbed this time.

<div class="comment">
<span id="comment_2336"></span>The team I used on this mission, not due to any of the ships being poor, but more to doing it quickly.<br />
Bhaalgorn (tank/DPS/wing leader) &lt; one hardener of each T2 EXP / Therm / Kin, 3 Aux Nano Pump I rigs, two T2 LARs &gt;<br />
Navy Apoc (secondary tank/DPS/ squad leader) &lt; one of hardener of each T2 EXP / Therm / Kin / EM, T2 EANM, 2 Aux Nano Pump I rigs, two Amarr Navy LARs &gt;<br />
Abbadon (DPS/secondary tank) &lt; standard mission tank fitted &gt;<br />
Myrm (DPS/Support) &lt; Rails, support drones &gt;<br />
Exequror (Remote Rep) &lt; 4 med logistic drones, 2-3 small RRs &gt;<br />
Its impracticly complex, and also too slow to keep at long range, but the 3 pulse laser ships kick out enough DPS to take out Darkanas in about 30-50 seconds, and the two support ships can provide help if needed. Wave 5 agroed both my support ships, all of our drones, and our abbadon, rather then either of our tanks, but we managed to knock out the Libertys before they managed to hurt us too bad. All in all, with that group I found it quick and easy, but again, impractical.

<span id="comment_2351"></span>I've done this a few times solo in a tech 1 fitted navy raven.  Here are the key points i used from above.<br />
<br />
1) Run.  Align to something and boogie.<br />
2) Target/Kill Republic Fleet D-1 Support Frigate because they web you.<br />
3) Do not touch Darkanas at all until the very end.  They just waste time.<br />
<br />
At the end, i dock then switch out to Valkyrie (exp drones) to make the Darkana kill faster.

<span id="comment_2841"></span>After reading all the comments both here and at Nathan32Derby UK's guide I was able to complete this mission in a fully T2 fitted passive Drake with Hobgoblin II's.<br />
<br />
I aligned away from the Smuggler Stargate as soon as I warped in and took out the smaller ships first.  I took out all of wave 1 except the two Battleships, one was almost dead, before wave 2 spawned.<br />
<br />
Again, I took the smaller ships out first but I was unable to finish off the first Darkana before wave three arrived, missile skills still not optimal and I had no offensive mods.<br />
<br />
I worked on my tanking skills first since those take less time to learn and the Drake is awesome for tanking level 3's &amp; 4's.<br />
<br />
I repeated the process of killing the smaller ships, Frigates &amp; Cruisers, before working on the Battleships.<br />
<br />
I had to warp out twice during this whole process, first time because I got so far away from the Smuggler Stargate that my enemies started falling back to the gate, out of my range.  So I warped away to get back to the stargate and closer to my targets.  <br />
<br />
Second warp out was due to too much damage coming my way and my shield recharge was past it's peak, but I was able to take out a Darkana just before I had to leave so when I returned I only had six Battleships to deal with on my return, 1 Liberty and 5 Darkana.<br />
<br />
Below is the fitting I was running.  I know it's not optimal, but it works and I like the lazy-man style of it.<br />
<br />
Slow and Steady wins the race.<br />

<span id="comment_4310"></span>I don't know what went wrong but I somehow ended getting bundled by ALL spawns at the same time. My n00b fit raven was toast. Infact I lost 2 Ravens to this mission, after losing the second one I was so emotionally distressed I went back to the agent and quit the mission. <br />
<br />
I warped in and ended up smack in the middle of an imaginary square with a spawn at each of the four corners, equidistance from me. I picked a corner spawn, headed towards it to increase my distance from the others and started firing. Within a minute I was getting critically low on shields and warped out. Next time I warped in I aligned, my shields melted within seconds and I started to warp out, before I'd even aligned/warped I was dead.<br />
<br />
I got backup from a corp mate, he brought his CNR fitted totally with faction kit (more than 1 billion ISK worth). He warped in, killed 1 BS in a few seconds and had to immediately warp out. I had followed him in just as he warped out and I couldn't last the 17 seconds it takes to align and warp out... another Raven dead.<br />
<br />
My corp mate double checked this page and said I had somehow ended up with all of the spawns and approx 3000 DPS which is impossible to tank.<br />
<br />
I don't understand what the point is of ppl posting here that they completed the mission in some 2 billion ISK tech III ship - of course you completed it easily, you're in a ship with more power than god.

<br />
Why are you using Fusion instead of Phased Plasma? Gallente are weak against Kinetic and Thermic, the Orions are extremely resistant against Kinetic, but have Thermal at 50% armor, 20% shields. Your tank is also configured wrong. You should be using kinetic and thermic hards only, your T2 resist will cover the Thunderbolts that the Officers fire. The tracking computer isn't necessary, especially with the TE's.<br />
<br />
I don't mean to be critical, but I didn't think it was a good idea to not point out what would increase your tankability and overall mission speed.

<br />
Enemies abound 5/5 is against minmatar not gallente. So your point is moot. the tracking computer was a trade off between pithi a-type medium shield booster + ambit rigs, or the gisti c-type large + CCC rigs, the latter was cheaper. Also getting as much falloff as possible increases your effective dps at 40KM (near opt + 0.5xfalloff). Tracking computers with optimal range scripts increase fall off as well (mine is at 71km).<br />
<br />
as for optimal missioning tank/speed, for me this is a good balance. I can trade off the TC for a SBA but then my effective dps suffers since i don't hit out as hard at max tractor ranges. adding a 4th gyro doesnt really add dps since i would have to replace a TE II for it, and again my dps @ 40km suffers.  I use tech 2 hardeners because i am not in the mood to pimp out a tank that barely gets used since my dps is so freakin high, the gisti c-type makes me stable enough to perma tank in case i get a d/c.

<span id="comment_4438"></span>When I saw the post, I saw it as part 4, that was my mistake and I apologize. Standard Vargur with that should be hitting at 50+km, well within tractor range.<br />
<br />
When it comes to TEs versus rigs (ambit), the TEs are considerably better. One TE equals two rigs. Dominion changed a lot of how Minmatar ships are likely to be fit.

Sounds more like you warped in and weren't fast enough to kill the initial spawn within 4 minutes, so you got the 2nd spawn as well, then the 3rd and 4th, before you'd finished off the initial group.<br />
<br />
Also a 1bil faction fit CNR is really not that great, a fully faction-fit Golem with a deadspace shield booster is more in line with the DPS dealt in this mission. Alternatively, a passive-tank Drake as posted by SaenWolfe will have little trouble providing you can kill the enemies fast enough.

<div class="comment">
<span id="comment_5202"></span>Here's information about my first (and successful) attempt on this mission, I hope it'll help you.<br />
<br />
First off, I earned around 42m ISK in 90 minutes with this mission, salvaging and looting included. That's pretty awesome and probably the best ISK/time ratio in any L4 I ever flew.<br />
Pilots with more SP than me (got humble 2.7m as of now) can probably do it much faster, thus increasing ISK/time ratio. Work it out for yourself.<br />
Note that I sold the loot directly at the mission hub, if I had hauled it to Jita with my alt it'd certainly have yielded like 20-30% more. That's &gt;55m in 90 minutes, then.<br />
I flew a Navy Scorpion with faction cruise launchers, 3 damage mods (T2) and faction X-Large shield booster. The important thing here is that I always take a cap booster with me on L4s. During this mission I used up all my 800-boosters, I think 15 in total ^^<br />
<br />
Now regarding the mission itself:<br />
I warped out a single time to buy more cap boosters.<br />
The thing about a Navy Scorpion is that it has a gigantic target range. I have low skills so &quot;only&quot; 99 km which is really really extremely useful in this mission. If you have problems taking too much damage... with 99 km target range you can happily out-range those baad Darkanas. With a CNR you're probably in their range all the time and since Darkanas spam EM torpedoes... well, it's not nice.<br />
<br />
So in conclusion what you do to finish this mission without too much trouble:<br />
1. always fly away with afterburner. Only turn around once everything in target range is down.<br />
2. use your drones to get rid of C-1/D-1 webbers and to kill cruiser-sized craft (especially in the first wave)<br />
3. use cap-boosters!! I used more than 2.5 times my actual cap, probably even more thanks to cap-boosters. They're really really useful in this mission and will help you not only survive the nasty first wave but also reduce the number of times you have to warp out (mind you, pilots with more than my 2.7m SP and about the same target range won't have to at all)<br />
4. as mentioned in the mission info above, Darkana are best killed with explosive damage so bring it or be doomed ^^<br />
5. take care of your drones, consider calling them back and putting em into fight again each time a new wave spawns<br />
6. On a sidenote, Freedom Patriots really hurt, kill them as fast as possible and before they're in optimum range. This should have priority even to battleships.<br />
<br />
<br />
If you follow those rules the mission won't be easy but definitely not too bad.<br />
I personally think this is the second-toughest L4 mission (after 'Worlds Collide', of course) and that shouldn't surprise. There are 5 or more elite BS in it, lots of other BS, webbers and cruisers that hit abnormally hard.<br />
Hardest part was wave one but I didn't get into real problems. Just afterburn away from the spawn point and kill the cruisers as fast as possible, they really hurt.<br />
<br />
::: ------ UPDATE ------- :::<br />
<br />
I now did this mission the second time. And it has become rather easy! When you've finished it once you'll always know better which enemies to kill first and how to behave. This time I didn't even have to warp out to buy more boosters, actually I used only 11. <br />
I guess killing those Freedom Patriots as soon as they were in max target range helped a lot. Outrunning Darkana torpedo range, it was quite an easy job. Maybe with faction weapons and shieldbooster you're already in a position to relax in every L4 mission, even with humble 2.75m SP ^^<br />
<br />
::: ------ UPDATE END ------ :::<br />
<br />
<br />
A really tough L4 but also the most rewarding... by far. Even Angel Extravaganza or Gone Berserk are far behind in terms of ISK/time. Not to mention laughable Worlds Collide which features insane enemy DPS in room 2 but offers comparatively low rewards.<br />
Good luck and remember: range is everything.<br />

<span id="comment_5318"></span>Just completed in a Drake.<br />
<br />
Burned away on AB after warp in and picked off targets, leaving the Darkanas until last. Pulling away kept swams strung out and incoming DPS manageable.<br />
<br />
Then bought in my alt in a fast picket to start salvaging but found the Darkanas targeted it. By keeping 60k+ distance avoided any damage and started to salvage.<br />
<br />
With the Darkanas targeting the frigate, they went down very, very quickly to my Drake (perhaps a hint to try?).<br />
<br />
Took me longer to take down the gate at the end then it did to clear the entire room!!<br />
<br />

<br />
I soloed this in a Navy Geddon, it's not that hard as long as you don't run out of cap, I ran out of cap at the fifth wave, came back and then they were all on top of me at the warp in point, even though there weren't really that many, it was rough.  I had left all the darkanas, so they were well within in range on my first return and spamming moljinor's, the solution was to go back again and throw on two EM hardeners.  <br />
<br />
It wasn't the prettiest sight but it was fairly quick.  Nice loot.

Following the tips I read here, before the spawns with Darkanas I would reload with Exp missiles and finish them off first, reload with Therm and proceed. Hobgoblins on frigates and Hammerheads on Cruisers.<br />
Had 1 ship left during 1st and 4th spawn. Finished 2nd and 5th well before the next wave. No scrams and a couple of webs.<br />
Loot is excellent (1 meta 4 worth 7mil, and 3,000m3 of assorted items) plus the tags which are worth 20-30mil.

First time i followed the advice in the mission report, and did not fit any EM hardeners.<br />
Had to warp out on the end of wave 3 with the income of wave 4, Almost got my golem destroyed when i came back, DPS was MUCH Stronger than anything else with all 3 last wave... Too much EM damage, and the ship were Heat resistant. Do not warp out !<br />
<br />
Did it another time today, without any problem at all since i focused darkanas.<br />

Inferno javelin and t1 torpedoes<br />

Well now the strat was to pop out all BS , drones on fregs and cruiser (they are very weaks, drone rapped them) and dps BS with torp.<br />
Got rid of each wave under 2 minutes, so i could regen capa between each wave.<br />
When darkana Pop, overloaded afterburner rushed on them ,fit Bane javelin torp and focused them.<br />
<br />
The darkana seems to be the key when doing it in Battleship class.<br />
And they have a pretty good resist against Heat.<br />
Now with bane javelin they got killed with 3 or 4 volley.<br />
<br />
Fit inferno torp for the other ships.<br />
<br />
I had NO trouble at all, not anytime close from danger, run smooth and worryless.<br />
