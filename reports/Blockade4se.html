Faction: Serpentis<br />
Mission type: Encounter<br />
Space type: Normal space<br />
Damage dealt: TH/KI<br />
Recommended damage dealing: Kinetic/Thermal<br />
Web/scramble: Stasis Tower, Guardian frigates in final spawn<br />

Recommended ships: HML Tengu, Cerberus, Dominix, Ishtar<br />
<br />
<h3>Single pocket</h3>

<strong>Spawns and triggers vary.</strong> Below is an example of waves.<br />
Usually the odd-one-out battleship is the trigger in this mission.<br />
All groups auto-aggro. Drones might get aggroed.<br />
<br />
<h4>Initial Group</h4>

5x Battleships:<br />
<div class="indent">1x Core Port Admiral <strong>Trigger</strong><br />
4x Core Rear Admiral</div>
3x Destroyers (Corelior Sentinel)<br />
1x Stasis Tower<br />
<br />
<h4>Spawn 1</h4>

45km - 85km away<br />
5x Battleships:<br />
<div class="indent">1x Core Vice Admiral <strong>Trigger</strong><br />
4x Core Rear Admiral (Orbit at 37km)</div>
3x Battlecruisers (Corelatis Platoon Leader)<br />
10x Cruisers:<br />
<div class="indent">3x Corelium Guardian Chief Watchman<br />
7x Corelium Guardian Chief Sentinel</div>
3x Destroyers (Corelior Trooper)<br />
<br />
<h4>Spawn 2</h4>

50km - 90km away<br />
4x Battleships:<br />
<div class="indent">1x Core Vice Admiral <strong>Trigger</strong><br />
3x Core Rear Admiral</div>
1x Destroyer (Corelior Sentinel)<br />
1x Frigate (Coreli Guardian Patroller)<br />
<br />
<h4>Spawn 3</h4>

70km - 90km away<br />
5x Battleships:<br />
<div class="indent">1x Core Rear Admiral <strong>Trigger</strong><br />
4x Core High Admiral</div>
2x Cruisers (Guardian Chief Guard)<br />
2x Frigates (Coreli Guardian Patroller)<br />
<br />
<h4>Spawn 4</h4>

4x Battleships:<br />
<div class="indent">3x Core High Admiral<br />
1x Core Lord Admiral</div>
4x Frigates (Coreli Guardian Watchman/Initiate)<br />
<br />
<h3>Tips</h3>

There is no drone agression in this mission.<br />
As especially Spawn 1 uses very heavy damping, it's advisable to leave drones out so they can start killing the damping ships. Fitting at least one Sensor Booster module is very helpful as well, do not forget to bring scripts. Or for us Missle Folks just bring a good supply of F.O.F they work well in this situation. <br />
<br />
<h3>Blitz</h3>

When the Core Lord Admiral is killed, the mission is complete. Shooting the triggers first to blitz the mission is possible, but not recommended due to very high incoming dps. <br />
<br />
<h3>Bounty</h3>

22,486,800.00 (full clear)<br />
<br />
<h3>Additional Info</h3>

There is rarely another spawn along with the final one. Even more rarely this single ship spawn can be a Shadow Serpentis BS, with the usual chance for faction items and higher bounty.<br />

<span id="comment_411"></span>great mission one of the best just takes time and alot of ammo so fill ur hold the cruiser really dampen you so make sure you have drones set to aggro if you are using duel reps 2 kin and a therm hardener will work fine you rarely have to use second rep

<br />
In the version where group 4 has 4x the same battleship, the trigger seems to be the one that comes in the group with cruisers/frigs. The other three are a bit on their own.

<span id="comment_662"></span>It's a good idea to fit 2 sensor booster for long range and shoot the NPC's from a sniper position (100km). Most of the dampening cruiser are then an easy target.

<span id="comment_2893"></span>Dominix does well here, sentry's and rails.<br />
When group two triggered i warped out and came back at 100km, got my Garde's out in time with aggressive mode on and they started popping targets as they flew to me.<br />
With 2 each N-Type Therm and Kin hardeners all i needed for this was a MAR II to tank most of the damage, used a LAR II for a couple of cycles with group two but wasnt really needed.<br />
Tip: Get your drones out as quick as when group 2 shows, if you havent got them attacking before you get damped then warping out is the only reasonable option for a drone boat.

<span id="comment_3779"></span>Done with a Gila, Kin-Missiles, Warden, Hammerheads and Ogre since you have to move a bit when the small frigs , cruisers and destroyers come closer. They do that since you cannot target anything mostly. The dampening is really a bit too much for my mind. <br />
But with Gila easy going. When the Waves spawn I put Drones on Aggro and do the Hammerheads do their work. Just watch them if they shoot the trigger. Bring an Afterburner and get closer if you cannot target anything. Target and direct your drones to the dampers. Those are mostly cruisers. <br />
All in all: If you know how it is very easy.<br />
I really have problems with a Megathron though, since I rely on range in that ship.

<span id="comment_4319"></span>Caution- 08 Apr 2010:  Performed mission in Tolle.  Every (and I mean every spawn) had the same class of BS.  No way to determine trigger.  Some evil do'er has changed the mission or something just glitched for me.   Keep an eye on this and post if this isn't an issue.  I had to warp out many times and place bookmark on wreck just to gain distance and deal with undetermined trigger(very difficult).  If this mission has changed, it is a change that isn't worth doing the mission.

<div class="comment">
<span id="comment_5947"></span>Sometimes there is no way to tell which ship is the trigger, as you will often get 4 of the same type of battleship. I have done this mission 3 times and in all 3 I have gotten at least one set in which the trigger shared its type with a non-trigger, in one trial there were two such sets.<br />
<br />
I'd advise against accepting this mission unless you rarely have difficulty tanking level 4 missions. The dps output is pretty high with one group alone, but it's just too easy to get stuck with more, and it's hard to gun them down quickly because they attack at long range while using sensor dampeners.

<span id="comment_6377"></span>This mission used to take me about 70 minutes to complete in a Drake but now I can do it in 34 minutes in a CNR (full kill, no blitz). I use F.O.F. missiles and drones to kill the jammers, after moving 40 or 50 km away from the merchant gate. Everything else is popped with T2 Wrath Fury missiles. I made a total of 35.2 million ISK (Reward/Bonus: 2.6, Bounty: 19.4, Loot/Salvage: 13.2).

Did mission before logging off, so left the last ship, &amp; can do it again tomorrow. Must be the most profitable L4 mission, along with worlds collide, though I never seem to get the faction loot in that one.

<span id="comment_7909"></span>Ran with Vexor Navy Issue with high (88% th/kin) armor resists, active tank with single MAR II and MWD. My tactic was - pick a BS and close the distance quickly; orbit it at something like 1000 meters. NOS (2x Medium Diminishing Power System Drain I) ensured that cap was stable with all tank modules working. Light drones took care of the small stuff, then heavy drones chewed through the rest. Damping was insane, but who cares when orbiting at 1000 m.<br />
<br />
Drones may be set on Aggressive, but should be watched - don't let them engage trigger targets prematurely.<br />
<br />
The tank held very nicely; armor was above 85% most of the time and only once fell to about 60%. Cap rarely fell below 50%.<br />
<br />
Overall, fun mission to do in Vexor, although somewhat time consuming.
