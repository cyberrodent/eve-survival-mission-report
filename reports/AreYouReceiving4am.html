<span id="comment_1140"></span>The first part of the mission HAS scramblers. The elite frigates fall into 2 groups: 2 target disruptors and 4 webbers out of which, 2 also warpscramble. Was a second too late and got webbed and neuted so fast, lost my BS in less than 2 minutes after warping in. If you value your ship, go in with a passive BC or bring some DPS to nuke the array and get out in 20-30s tops. Good drone skills are also a must as once they get their neut on you, your cap goes down real fast.

<span id="comment_1143"></span>I did this in a Mael with 5 T1 med drones, 8 1400mm scout, 3 T2 hardners, X-Large Boost II, and 80 max cap charge p/sec.  Had to turn the booster off and on but that wasn't an issue since the dmg is low.  Hardners were on the whole time.

<span id="comment_1353"></span>For Part 1 I decided to ignore above comments and went in in an active tanked Golem. My plan was to blitz it. However I started aligning for warp almost immediately and this moved me towards the group, and 2 seconds before the array popped I was scrambled. It was no problem at all taking everything out, but keep in mind my skills are pretty much maxed (43mill SP atm), including my TP, shield boost, cap recharge and capacity, shield recharge and capacity, drones, etc.<br />
My cap did not drop below 66% while keeping the shield above 50%. Did have a cap recharger II, heavy NOS and drones that took out the scramblers first just in case. <br />
So 2 comments here: <br />
1. I think so long as you go in with enough cap recharge, and have the damage to take out the smaller targets (ie. Target painter and drones), this mission is no probs. Damage was about medium (ie. quite high for such small ships).<br />
2. If you plan to Blitz move away from the structure while shooting it (depending on your damage possibly with an AB) to avoid being scrambled before its destroyed.<br />
Also one of the cruisers dropped a medium unstable power fluctuator which was worth about 12mill in the region I was in.

<span id="comment_2073"></span>I think the cap recharge is more important here for Raven clases. With 210 or so all parts are pice <br />
of cake. Just take a few fields [therm/kinet/explo], and x-large shield booster can work all the time. <br />
I was never below 95 procents on shield with 80-95 procents on capacitor. Gl.

<span id="comment_2181"></span>Part 3 has TWO reinforcement waves, not one.<br />
The initial spawn is actually three &quot;The Transport Ship&quot;, two Gist Warlord, and 3 Gistii Ambusher.<br />
What's listed above as the &quot;initial spawn&quot; is actually the first reinforcement wave. The second, which appears when all of those are killed, was 4 Gist Throne and 4 Gistatis Legionnaire. Very heavy explosive damage on that wave, I had to warp out and repair, then come back and afterburn to 30km and kite them

<span id="comment_2182"></span>... until I'd killed off enough of the DPS to get close again. Recommend taking out the Legionnaires of the last wave first. I did the Thrones first, and was still getting hammered by those BCs, they have pretty heavy explosive DPS.<br />
<br />
The transport ships aggroed my drones, but had pretty weak DPS and never got through their shields.<br />
<br />
Done in a Typhoon, 3x CCC rigs, T2 LAR, 4x T2 hardeners, 2x T2 ballistic controls, 2x T2 Cap Rechargers, 1x T2 Tracking Computer, 1x LiF afterburner, 4x 800mm 'scout' autocannons (Fusion ammo), 4x caldari navy cruise launchers (Devastator missiles), 5x Berserker I and 5x Valkyrie I. (The Berserkers killed the few frigates just fine though so I didn't use the medium drones.)

<span id="comment_4502"></span>Part 1 is gate-less deadspace. It can therefore be sniped.<br />
<br />
Warp in with a shuttle, drop a bookmark. Warp back to station. You can test the bookmark by warping to the bookmark within 100K. Repeat the process to get even a larger distance. When you're confident you have enough distance, get your sniper ship. Kill frigates first, then the cruised-sized ships at leasure.<br />
<br />
2 Phased Weapon Navigation arrays and precision cruise missiles made minced-meat out of all the rats.<br />
<br />
At 100K+, enemy DPS comes from the Tower Sentries. Using Beam Lasers, they have a very long Optimum Range.<br />
<br />
Done in a cap-stable Golem, 4 Cruise Luanchers II, X-Large Shield Booster, 1 Heat and 1 EM Hardener tech II, 2 Phased Weapon Navigation Array, 2 Cap Booster II's, 4 Ballistic Controls II, 2 CCC Rigs.<br />
<br />
None of the rats came in range to do any damage or their EW on me.

<span id="comment_5322"></span>I have also almost lost a ship to part one of this mission. This time I did in passive tanked Maelstrom with my alt in a Domi for remote repair and using large shield repper drones. I used 800mm autocannons and 2 200mm ac for the frigs. Worked very well.

<span id="comment_6680"></span>I got this mission for the first time today and didn't read the comments carefully. D'oh.<br />
<br />
However, if you stay more than about 20km away they can't neut/NOS you. I ended up orbiting at 25km to have a bit of safety margin, rather than my more normal 10km. With medium AC and good skills this put me about about optimal+falloff so there were misses but I still did the DPS to take out the tacklers, Neuts and NOS boats, then get closer on the other stuff.<br />
<br />
Elite cruisers are much harder to kill than BCs btw. Much better resists and Armour Repping.<br />
<br />
Fortunately it only cost me some drones.

<span id="comment_6687"></span>I had a slightly different mix to DonnaBlitzenn, but agree with three waves. I had 3 transport ships, I think it was 2 Gist Warlords and Gistatis Legionnaires. First reinforcement was similar to listed initial wave, third wave was 4 Gist Malakim and 3 battlecruiser (Tribunis I think).

<div class="comment">
<span id="comment_7672"></span>After the Odyssey update this set of missions is fairly easy to do in a Sentry-Drone t2 tanked Domi. Even the neuting in part 1 isn't ferocious enough to be a real threat as long as you target neuting ships first. You might like to fit with small/medium turrets to supplement the sentries through.
