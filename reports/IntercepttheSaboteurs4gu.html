Spawns may vary, this is just an example.<br />
<br />
<br />
<h3>Warp-In</h3>

<h5>(Acceleration Gate)</h5>

3x Frigates (Pithi Destructor/Demolisher)<br />
2x Destroyers (Pithior Guerilla/Terrorist)<br />
<br />
<br />
<h3>Single Pocket</h3>

Attacking group 2a aggros entire pocket.<br />
Attacking groups 1 or 3 will usually aggro that group and group 2a.<br />
Drones might be aggroed by neutral groups due to proximity.<br />
Attacking an elite frigate in group 2b or group 4 will only aggro that group, which can be sniped at leisure.<br />
<br />
Confiscated Viral Agent is dropped by the last defeated ship in group 2a (mission completion trigger). <br />

<span id="comment_217"></span>Transporters can drop the viral agent. In fact , it always was the case for me , because I always kill the transporters last (they're very close, so easier to loot the viral agent). Perhaps your mission session had a bug ToirIn

<div class="comment">
<span id="comment_996"></span>The groups as discussed above are no longer true [Nov 8, 2008].  I found that the frigates and destroyers were segregated into two groups, each having about half of both and no larger ships.  Both of these groups agro'd independently of all other groups.  [I shot the jammers first.  :-)]<br />
<br />
Then the other ships formed two groups also, each with about half the ships, and each agro'd independently of the other.<br />
<br />
Transports were part of my first frigate group [toward the center as you warp in].<br />
<br />
Blitz is now possible -- just shoot the center group of frigates and the transports.<br />
<br />
[In case I'm wrong about this ... do it from 75km out like I did with my T1 Raven.]

<span id="comment_1160"></span>i did it many times so easy way was :<br />
 Target 6x scramble frigs and kill them , you will get aggro of couple more frigs not others ( drones will get aggro of group 2 , so don't use drones)<br />
attacking group 3 will aggro group 2 but not group 1<br />
attacking Group 2 will aggro all groups

<span id="comment_2373"></span>here is a tip to avoid getting aggroed both groups, worked for me anyway..so hope it works for you to...<br />
start with 6x Elite Frigates (Dire Pithi 1-Imputor/2-Arrogator/3-Invader/4-Infiltrator) (Web/Scramble)..in that order some other friggs will also aggro and you can just kill them all like you want the order is not that important only when you start.....like i said it worked for me and would also like someone to comfirm this.. cheers

<span id="comment_2506"></span>Followed JuniorChief's suggestion, got no aggro when attacking Elite Frigates, but aggro from Group 2 and 3 when attacking Frigates. Tanked them in a Drake (76% therm, 82% kin, 2LSE, 2SPR). Took out Cruisers/Battlecruisers then Battleships, then Frigates/Destroyers, left Transports till last. Mission completed withour engaging Group 1.

<span id="comment_2562"></span>Raven with T1 Therm+Kin Hardener, T1 Invul Field (1x) and passive Kin (1x). I shot group 3 first and got aggro from group 3 and 2. Kill all frigs with your drones and keep 1 or 2 larger ships targetted for your turrets and missiles. I had to warp out one time after all frigs of group 3 and 2 were killed. The damage of those cruisers/battlecruisers is low but sums up due to their large number. <br />
Fortunately these guys do not overwhelm you with missiles like other gurista encounters you may know.

<span id="comment_2698"></span>I run this with Armageddon with beam lasers and rather average skills (T1 hardeners, weapons and drones).<br />
1) Verified that you can shoot the scrambler Dire Pithis and only couple of more frigs are aggroing you.<br />
2) Verified that the BS with largest bounty drops the viral agent and not the transports.<br />
3) Verified that attacking group 2 aggroes all three groups BUT after warpout group 3 disengaged (or at least for me).<br />
4) Pithum Annihhilator/Nullifier did not jam me but the Pithum Eliminator (is named Extinguisher in this page - the BS with the largest bounty) did jam me occasionally.<br />
5) Loot and salvage was really crap.

<span id="comment_2835"></span>I consider the following a Blitz because I didn't have to kill the entire room. But I am still sorta' new to solo L4 so some may not consider this a 'Blitz'.<br />
Cruiser Raven with Large Booster II and 3x BCS. Drone Link Aug and Tractor. Lt and Med T2 Drones.<br />
Did this mission yesterday and just now again. Same both times.<br />
Upon warp in, Align yourself to a station or gate moving away from all groups. Target and fire on one of the frigs in group 3 and you will get aggro from both group 3 and group 2. The aggro will include the 3 Transport ships. (Do not target the Transports if your drones are set to aggressive). Kill all starting small and working your way up killing the 2 BS's (saving the 3 Transports for last). Mission objective drops from 3rd Transport killed. <br />
There will be another spawn of Frigates in place of group 2 but they do not auto aggro. Group 1 does not auto aggro. Short and sweet.

Started off immediately flying away from all three groups. Sniped frigates in Group3, Both Group3 and Group2 aggroed, took out jammers and elite frigates first. Used drones to take out the rest of the frigates and destroyers and missiles to work on Battleships down. I left transports for last, last transport dropped the agent.<br />

Blitz (accidental): Aiming for the elites, drove straight past the Transports until inside their group's aggro sphere (about 25-35 km). Was attacked by part of Group 2, including the BS - but NOT the elites or any ships in groups 1 or 3. Flew away, followed by all the attackers including the transports (easily tanked). Last transport dropped the objective. Drones were aggroed heavily, so took out the frigs/destroyers with Precision missiles.<br />
<br />
'Group 2' seemed to be 3 groups - the transport ships and their escorts, and L &amp; R frigate groups (elites were split between these). Attacking the frigate groups didn't draw any aggro from the other groups.

<span id="comment_4673"></span>Seems to be a little randomness to the grouping:<br />
I warped in and remained stationary, then<br />
- aggroed Dire Pithi Arrogator, got aggro from the other 2 plus 3 frigates<br />
- aggroed Dire Pithi Invader, got aggro from the other 2 plus 3 frigates<br />
Everything else remained silent in both cases. <br />
- aggroed a Destroyer in group 3, got aggro from groups 2 and 3<br />
- killed the 3 Transport Ships last, the required item dropped from the last one of them<br />
<br />
So there might be 5 groups after all. And this looks more or less like a candidate for a (moderate) Blitz to me. <br />
If it is repeatable, that is. Anyone?

Seems to me like the groups and aggro are a bit like described by Livia: shooting the dires aggroed only some frigs and not even all dires, shooting the Transports aggroed all however.

Shot @ group 3 and 2 aggroed as well... mission was flagged complete after killed the last ship from 2 and 3. (Didnt even lock anything in group 1). Last ship was a BS so had to slowboat 20k to get the loot.

<span id="comment_5155"></span>There are 4 groups in this mission. The 4th being a group of frigates that defend the 6 armouries at the rear of the shipyard cluster. The cannister is released from the last non frigate killed, so if you leave the transport ships to the very last after you have dispatched all the other ships from groups 2,3 and 4, you will not have to travel more than 1-3 kms from your warp-in position because the transport ships like to get really close to you

<span id="comment_5156"></span>There are 6 frigs guarding the armouries at the rear. There are 2 aggro groupings. If you attack group 3 first you will also be aggroed by group 2 but not group 1 or the frigs at the rear. So, as long as you leave them alone they will do likewise. Be aware though, that group 3 is drone / team mate unfriendly and they seem to have an aggro range of 50-60 kms. There is ammo and other items to be had from the armouries and the habitation modules but be careful to dump the illegal drugs if you dont want a fine and standings hit from the local police

<span id="comment_5321"></span>Two things became clear after my last run:<br />
1. the grouping in the description is wrong. There are more groups than we currently have in the description. I aggroed 3 of the elite frigs (the 3 closer ones), and only they and 3 regular frigs returned fire. Then I aggroed the closest pair of destroyers (in group 3), and got return fire from group 3 and the transports and a few other ships.<br />
2. there appears to be a blitz after all: I killed only the ships that returned fire. Of these I killed the 3 transports last, and the last of them dopped the can. So far it is, of course, not clear whether killing the elite frigs is necessary at all. However, if this proves to be repeatable you can reduce the time required for running this mission by a substantial percentage even in this way.

<br />
1) Highest bounty battleship seems to drop the mission item; Confirm?<br />
2) Sniping the frigates at a distance doesn't aggro all of them, bug you are able to aggro the rest without aggroing anything else than frigs.<br />
3) Decent Reward for a couple of minutes with a tengu.

<span id="comment_6398"></span>how to Blitz 101<br />
1. kill everything necessary to enter pocket 2<br />
2. approach a transport, when you do this for the first time. keep approaching until the group around the transports aggros you. Stop your ship (just in case you get too close to another group. Start killing the ships in the group around the transport. The last ship in that peticular group will drop the mission-item.<br />
<br />
Slightly delayed after the ships in the transport-group, a group of cruiser/BCs on your left will aggro you, too. They are not necessary to finish the mission.<br />
You will also see 2 groups of frigs/destroyers (didn't check thoroughly) that will NOT aggro you, if you do it right.

<span id="comment_6961"></span>All five (there are five) groups can be aggro'd separately. First, I flew to the right to get proximity aggro from the rightmost group and was able to pull only that group. Then, I flew to the left and pulled only that group. Then I approached the left side of the center and was able to pull only that group. One of the ships in this group dropped the mission objective. This left the two groups of frigates in the center. There is one group guarding the outpost, and one on the armory. They can be pulled separately as well. If you have a good tank, it's much quicker to take several groups, or the whole room, at a time, but it can be done this way.  Just be sure to get proximity aggro and don't target/shoot anything untill the group has been pulled.

<br />
Group 2 had 6 regular frigates, 2 destroyers, and 3 elite frigates. Attacking one of the regular frigates (should have been group 2b) caused stage aggro.<br />
<br />
I recommend doing this mission with railguns. The frigates took long enough to get to me that I was able to take most of them out with the rails. Even with stage aggro, I was able to take out several cruisers before having to warp out. The cruisers and battleships all stayed at a good shooting distance, while the transports ran right up next to me. I never got scrambled. Completed in megathron with 425mm rails, strong kin/therm tank, and ECCM.
