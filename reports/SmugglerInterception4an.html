<h2>Pocket 1</h2>

Easy to aggro the entire room.  <br />
<em>Attacking the leftmost group aggroes also the foremost group. Drones should aggro, use caution. </em><br />
<br />
<img src="http://go-dl.eve-files.com/media/1203/smugglerinterception4ac-1%5B1%5D.jpg" alt="Pocket 1" title="Pocket 1" /><br />
<br />
<h4>Group 1 (60 km) (center front):  (Will aggro entire room)</h4>

2x Battleships (Gist Commander, Gist General)<br />
3x Elite Cruiser (Gist Marauder)<br />
2x Frigate  (Gistii Raider)<br />
<br />
<h4>Group 2 (85km) (right rear):</h4>

3x Cruiser (Gistum Defeater, Gistum Phalanx)<br />
<br />
<h4>Group 3 (80 km)  (far left): (Will aggro group 1)</h4>

3x Cruiser (Gistum Breaker, Gistum Defeater)<br />
2x Battlecruiser (Gistatis Legionnaire<br />
<br />
<h4>Group 4 (90km)   (mid left): </h4>

3x Battleship (Gist Commander, Gist General, Gist War General)<br />
3x Cruiser (Gistum Crusher, Gistum Smasher)<br />
<br />
Gate is 28km away<br />
<br />
<h2>Pocket 2</h2>

Attacking the solo Frigate group did not draw aggro, firing on another group drew the entire room.<br />
You can attack the top groups and ignore the bottom group of annoying frigates. My drones didn't aggro them either.<br />
<br />
<img src="http://go-dl.eve-files.com/media/1203/smugglerinterception4ac-2.jpg" alt="Pocket 2" title="Pocket 2" /><br />
<br />
<h4>Group 1: (60km) (Down right) (Draws no aggro)</h4>

4x Frigates (Gistii Impaler, Gistior Seizer)<br />
2x Elite Frigates (Arch Gistii Rogue, Arch Gistii Hijacker) <strong>Web/Scramble</strong><br />
<br />
<h4>Group 2: (90km) (Far Left)</h4>

2x Battlecruisers (Gistatis Tribunus, Gistatis Praefectus)<br />
<br />
<h4>Group 3: (60km) (Front)  (Aggros entire pocket)</h4>

4x Battelship (Gist General, Gist Warlord, Gist War General)<br />
2x Battlecruisers (Gistatis Praefectus)<br />
2x Transports (Angel Cartel Personnel Transport)<br />
<br />
<h4>Group 4: (70km) (Back Right) (Draws no aggro)</h4>

4x Battleships (Gist Commander, Gist General)<br />
2x Battlecruisers (Gistatis Praefectus)<br />
<br />
<h5>Structures</h5>

No loot is dropped by the ruined stargate or the cathedrals.<br />
<br />
<h4>BLITZ</h4>

Pocket 1: Kill everything<br />
Pocket 2: Only the ships in the group with the transports needs to be destroyed to complete objectives. Don't forget to loot 10 Militants.<br />
<br />
<br />
<h5>How to avoid stage-aggro:</h5>

1. Approach the group with the transports, fast ship recommended. Don't shoot first.<br />
2. Wait until the ships in that group aggro you. Now you can safely return fire on these 8 ships without drawing stage-aggro.<br />
<br />
<br />
<h5>Another approach</h5>

I've kited this in an armor-tanked Kronos without ever getting into armor(!) All you need in both pockets is an AB and keep range at around 70km, with guns that do good damage at that range. Hardly get hit at all.<br />
<br />
<h5>Video</h5>

This video is just one of many ways to do this mission. <br />

<span id="comment_111"></span>I have drawn this mission twice. Both times went well for the first few minutes and it would have been an easy completion (Typhoon), however after a few minutes my screen, keyboard, and mouse locked up and stayed locked up until I was in a pod. After that gameplay returned to normal. This has happened to me on both attempts at this mission approximately 1 month apart and both in Gyng system. A GM told me there was  nothing out of the ordinary on the server logs.<br />
<br />
I was curious if anyone else has experienced this, and if so to warn others of this possibility. My second account running at the same time in a different system was unaffected so it wasn't my machine or connection.<br />
<br />
As of now I would be very reluctant to attempt this mission again as losing a ship both times was rather upsetting, considering I was easily beating the mish up to the point where I could no longer target or fire.

<span id="comment_343"></span>Pocket 2 completely aggroed within a minute of my first shot. From my approach the left and right groups looked like one big group, so I targeted a Cruiser that was towards the right side, with the above result. They were faster than my Hype so it was iffy for a while, but the tank/cap held up. Next time I'll fit an Afterburner.

I got the frigate group first and let my medium drones take care of them.<br />
then fired a single shot at the far most right cruiser and only got 1 group.<br />
<br />
Another time same missions:<br />
fired a shot in the group after i got the frigates but now all came at once<br />

seems like its a bit of a gamble

for first pocket, since the damage is not that harsh, so i agroed the whole room, and took ~ 15 mins to clear all of them off using full L5 drone skills on T2 kinetic + L4 cruise + sub missle skills, definately the best if you are a shield tanker... 6-7 gangs of bs doesn't really hurts lolx

<span id="comment_1778"></span>In pocket 2 a Gistatis Praefectus is stuck on an object in space every single time at 92km or so. Took 54 volleys with 800mm AC and Barrage L to pop him. Does CCP act on complaints about such? One would think they have had plenty of time to put a fix in so rats don't get stuck.

<br />
In the first room I initially drew aggro from center front group and right rear group; had to run my repper for a bit. After taking care of the cruisers and frigates I speed tanked the BSs, shields hovered around the 40-60% mark.<br />
<br />
Center rear group was no problem - shield/speed tanked everything. Gistum Crusher target painted me.<br />
<br />
Final group of cruisers and BCs had me into armor again but didn't threaten my tank at all, only needed to pulse my MARII a couple of times.<br />
<br />
Second room: <br />
<br />
Lower right group of frigates was no problem of course. Then drew room aggro. Ran the repper pretty much continuously until the cruisers and BCs were gone, ran low on capacitor at one point due to using the AB the whole time.<br />
<br />
Then shield/speed tanked all the battleships.<br />
<br />
Overall very easy; didn't destroy the battleships as fast as I would have in my Abaddon, but the Legion was way more fun to fly.<br />
<br />
8.2m loot/salvage, 7.1m bounties, 2.6m mission, grand total 17.9m

<span id="comment_4915"></span>Heres something I figured out in the first pocket:<br />
turn away from the acceleration gate by 180°, pull entire room and then move to a spot approximately 60 km away from the gate. This will cause rats to loose aggro when they are about 50 km away from the gate...<br />
I tried it out several times and it works everytime.<br />

Pocket 1: went a bit to the left, attacked the left group. Middle group got agrood a bit later on but they moved very slow. Left group was gone before the middle group was in my range. Watch your drones though, I lost one when the whole middle group targeted them. Did receive practically no damage.<br />
<br />
Pocket 2: Turned right below me, killed them easily and then went to the far most left group with the transport. The last group joined when the transport group was almost dead. So, also here I received practically no damage<br />

Pocket 1: Shot for the right most group, and got aggro from the closest groups. The back left and back middle did not aggro.<br />
<br />
Pocket 2: Grabbed the frigates with no issue, then the right most group with no extra aggro.<br />
<br />
All in all, easy mission, just had that little hitch at the start. Aggro is random, maybe?

<span id="comment_8392"></span>Room 1: Group 2 and the solar array nearby have been moved to the inside left of station (long ago if I remember right). Crept up within 34km of them from beacon to start room. However Group 1 then aggros after first kill. Shooting group 4 later from that position also aggros Group 3.
