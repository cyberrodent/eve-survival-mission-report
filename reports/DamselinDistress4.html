I was just doing the L4 damsel in distress and noticed I 1 vollied Krull - no reinforcements wave as he didn't get time to shout he was under attack (pity cos I wanted the loot/isk).

<span id="comment_114"></span>I've complete this mission before and after Empyrean patch. Before patch I did accidentally attack of Kruul in first gates. And that caused spawn.<br />
Right after patch I got same mission again. This time I was smarter and didn't attack Kruul. But still they spawned.

<span id="comment_118"></span>If you want to avoid triggering the spawn prematurely then do not use drones at all until you are ready to attack Kruul, which will trigger them. Drones tend to accidently attack him on their own inbetween your target kills.

For that matter drones are best set to passive on any mission with triggers since they always seem to attack triggers first.

<span id="comment_215"></span>This mission is the best one IMHO to test your tank. The four spawns alltogether give about 1800/2000 dps all damages (because the assassins at the last spawn). The apocalypse navy issue runs this fury dps with dual officer LAR , 2x officer Kin hardeners , 2x officer Thermic hardener , 1x corpum A eanm. Don't try that if you don't have a perfect tank :)

Did it just yesterday thinking, why not try some Siege Launchers on my CNR, since the merc BS always come very close.<br />

Worked like a breeze, probably finished the mission twice as fast.

<span id="comment_294"></span>This is my favorite level 4 mission, if you set drones to passive till ur ready to take out kruul u shouldn't have any problem (after that u can just set them to aggressive again), also very easy to salvage case its all under 20kms.

- This was from 30km out, with 2kin/2therm/dc2 armour tank (Apocalypse Navy Issue). I think this explosion hits to 40km out as it always has. When I get real close I get around 2000 damge with the same tank.

<span id="comment_849"></span>As for what whorehouse is the right one, should you warp out and back in from another direction or so... the structures are not perfectly symmetrical. I need to check that but if you imagine the &quot;wall&quot; constructs around the whorehouses as two triangles pointing outwards, one has a slave pen structure in its tip. The right thingie to blow up should be the one on the other side, inside the &quot;empty tip&quot; triangle.

<span id="comment_910"></span>The warp-in beacon itself doesn't move. If one warps in from any direction, you can _still_ identify the correct Pleasure Garden without much ado. You can also center your view on the beacon to help with the bearings if you become disoriented.

<span id="comment_1335"></span>I have successfully done this mission in a passively tanked Drake.<br />
In the unrigged Drake, my shields auto repair rate is about 75 hp per second. All resistances between 76% and 80%.<br />
If you try that one out, i recommend to warp in at about 70 or 100km and keep away from them as far as your targetting and missile range allows. My max. is 75km atm. So I started hitting them at 75km and kept going until mz shields fell to aprox. 10% - then warped out to rebuild shields. Took me 2 warp-outs to get them all down.<br />
<br />
Complete setup I used (should only be around 45m ISK in total):<br />
<br />
4x Shield Power Relay II<br />
2x Magnetic Scattering Amplifier II<br />
1x Heat Dissipation Amplifier II<br />
1x Kinetic Deflection Amplifier II<br />
1x Explosion Dampening Amplifier II<br />
1x Large Shield Extender II<br />
<br />
7x Heavy Missile Launcher II, Caldari Navy Scourge or Scourge Fury Heavy Missile<br />
1x Medium Plasma Smartbomb II<br />
<br />
5x Acolyte II<br />
<br />
<br />
If you dont mind to spend another 45m ISK, you might want to add up to 3x Core Defence Field Purger I, which would probably remove the need to warp out, as it increases my auto-repair at shields up to 145 hp per second.

<br />
The key is managing the spawns, only one at a time, and start with those which you can kill fastest. (Use sentries as well.) That way, even if they are breaking your tank, they won't do it for enough time to have you warp out.<br />
<br />
Fantastic loot, yes. Oh, and be careful not to one-shot Kruul if you want more of it.

<span id="comment_1565"></span>Fairly heavy DPS mission, completed one spawn at a time with a Dominix: 2x LAR II, 1x DCU II, 1x Dark Blood kin/therm/exp. never had to warp out ... but aligned a couple times to prepare to. usually if you take out one of the Sentinels you should be ok.  And ... good loot but not so great salvage.  Also, second wave seemed to spawn with 25% armor TAKEN not remaining.

<span id="comment_3159"></span>This mission is FUN. I've done it in a Paladin and a Golem before, solo. It's very good for loot, bounties and salvage.<br />
<br />
If using a turret boat, mind transversal and try to pop some of the BSes before they get too close. If using a missile boat, laugh at them and load up on Kinetic. Seems to be the best damage type to use.<br />
<br />
If you're in a Golem, and using torpedoes, just load up 100% on Juggernauts, and watch them die. With T2 torpedo launchers and level 4 support for missiles, you should be able to pop them in 2-3 vollies.

<span id="comment_3607"></span>If you have an alt or a friend tagging along in a low level ship to help you salvage (so you don't have to deal with ninja looters) warn them to get the hell out of the area BEFORE you blow up the garden. It might SAY 30-40KM in the mission briefing in big, bold letters but my alt lost a Cormorant and we were about 60k out from the explosion. Stay on the safe side...have the little ship warp out and warp back in!

Just sit and let them (quickly) come to you and pick them off with your Gardes as they approach.  When they get into web range, web them and watch them melt in no time.

<span id="comment_6416"></span>My first spawn, the structure was at about 30% shield and 50% armor, second wave was near 10% hull. bit oh advice, use cheap T1 drones to destroy the pleasure garden from 50 km out. I took absolutely no damage at all from the explosion.<br />
<br />
Mission was run with a Blaster domi. 2 T2 LARs, 2 T2 kin and 2 T2 therm hardeners and a DCU for fun. only hard part was when the BS in the final spawn came out. didnt break me tank but made me sweat a bit. Just keep switching out Oger IIs for Hammerhead IIs depending on the ship you're shooting.

<span id="comment_6895"></span>I wanted to test my Gila's 1600 DPS tank vs. Mercs (according to the damage distribution listed - 63/24/6/7).  Note the Gila has pretty nice deadspace mods, T2 purgers, and a couple okay implants.  Was holding relatively well around 40% shields after spawning everything except the wave of 6 BSs labeled Spawn 1 above.  However, that was with a little speed tanking (212 m/s) as well.<br />
<br />
So, the estimate by BlasTerd is probably pretty accurate.  With absolutely everything spawned in this mission, you probably need about 2200 DPS tank if you want to just sit there and watch your ship get bombarded.  Fun stuff.

I always leave Kruul last, but today due to abit afking he was orbiting me at about 2k,so when I started engaging him, my 800's missed (doh) so it ended up that my drones took him out. Don't know if this was a glitch or not, but the result was no 6 BS spawn... :( rest of the spawns arrived as normal once the armor/hull reached it's damage levels...so avoid this if you want the 6 BS spawn.
