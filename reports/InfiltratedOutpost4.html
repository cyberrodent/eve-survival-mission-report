<br />
Note: The number of ships in a group will vary. This variance will be indicated in the ship numbers.<br />
<div class="indent">  The number of frigates and elite frigates will vary, but the sum will always equal the total frigate numbers as reported.</div>
<br />
<h3>Pocket 1</h3>

<br />
Auto aggro from Group 1 at warp-in. Group 2 remains neutral.<br />
Drones can be safely deployed to attack Group 1.<br />
<br />
The warp gate to the next pocket is about 35 km away.<br />
The gate is locked until you have eliminated all hostile ships.<br />
<br />
<img src="./screenshots/infiltratedoutpost4-1.jpg" alt="Pocket 1" title="Infiltrated Oupost (Pocket 1)" /><br />
<br />
<h4>Group 1: Drone Bunker (25km)</h4>

3x Frigates/Elite Frigates (Sunder/Raider/Strain Splinter Alvi) <strong>(Web/Scramble)</strong><br />
3x Cruisers (Viral Infector/Bomber Alvum)<br />
1x Battleship (Swarm Preserver Alvus/Alvus Controller)<br />
<br />
<h4>Group 2: Drone Bunker (48-52km)</h4>

3x Frigates/Elite Frigates (Decimator/Sunder/Raider/Strain Splinter Alvi) <strong>(Web/Scramble)</strong><br />
2x Cruisers (Viral Infector Alvum)<br />
1x Battlecruiser (Defeater Alvatis)<br />
<br />
<h5>Tip</h5>

<ul><li> The drone bunkers in this pocket are not part of the mission objective, so they can be ignored.
</li><li> Structures drop no loot.
</li><li> The Gate to Pocket 2 is 30 km from the warp-in, an afterburner can be useful.</li></ul>
<br />
<h3>Pocket 2</h3>

<br />
No aggro at warp-in. <br />
<br />
<span class="underline">Attacking Group 2 (or its bunker) will aggro the <strong>entire </strong>pocket</span>.<br />
Attacking either Group 1 OR 3 will aggro Group 2. <br />
<br />
Drones can be deployed safely, with one exception: Drones that get too close to any remaining neutral group will be attacked. <br />
<br />
<img src="./screenshots/infiltratedoutpost4-2.jpg" alt="Second pocket" title="Infiltrated Oupost (Pocket 2)" /><br />

3-4x Cruisers (Devastator/Disintegrator Alvum)<br />
1-2x Battlecruisers (Enforcer Alvatis)<br />

3-4x Cruisers (Devastator/Disintegrator Alvum)<br />
1-2x Battlecruisers (Enforcer Alvatis)<br />
1x Battleship (Alvus Controller)<br />
<br />
<h5>Tip</h5>

<ul><li> Mission is flagged completed after you have eliminated all ships in Group 2 and destroyed the bunker next to them.</li></ul>
<br />
<h5>Blitz</h5>

<span id="comment_181"></span>In a Raven: 1x EXP, 1x KIN, 2x Invul, 3BCS, deal: EM, 2 pockets<br />
pocket1 fly directly to gate, shoot ships on your way<br />
pocket2: attacking the nearest group to you aggros the second group next to it. I killed them all before anything happened really. Shield never went lower than 70% unboosted. Killing the 3rd group is easy too.<br />
Lastly destroy the three &quot;drone bunkers&quot;. <br />
MY difficulty rating for this mission is: very easy for Level 4.

<span id="comment_227"></span>Golem or CNR should not be placed as &quot;recommended&quot; ships , as it's the case in many other missions.<br />
Any t1 non faction bs can finish the mission with 2x explo hardeners, 1x kin + 1x thermic + 1x Em hardeners.<br />
Stop recommend very expensive ships when &quot;normal&quot; ships are easily able to finish missions please.

BS really doesn't shave much time off that given the massive amount of frigate size ships.

<br />
That depends on what you have on that BS, i have huge turrets but finish it in 10 - 12 minutes. All you i need against the small ships is 30 km's distance and 0.001 angular velocity. (Or less than 30 m/s transversal).<br />
They go pop-pop-pop purty quick, those who make it through are dronefood.

<span id="comment_442"></span>On a megapulse abaddon I've done this mission about 5 times recently and not once run out of shields, even. Pathetically easy. I wouldn't outright suggest taking no tank, but I used LAR+2 hardeners just as safety net (very few scramming drones anyway) and filled up on HS/TE. The TE especially nice for the masses of frigs.

<span id="comment_615"></span>Found this mission fairly easy, i did have extra firepower watching my back, but i found when i warped into the second room, i could draw complete aggro, align, and just move off, i never had more than 5 ships in range at a time. even solo i wouldnt have had any trouble.<br />
they never broke my shields, but i used a tempest, 100mn AB II with LAR II, 2x explo II and 1x kin + therm II

<span id="comment_701"></span>I agree, this mission gets a &quot;very easy&quot; on my rating.<br />
<br />
I'm flying a sleipnir fitted with <br />
7x scout autocannons, 1x HAM launcher<br />
t2 large shield booster, t2 boost amp, t2 AB, t2 kin and exp hardners.<br />
t2 damage control, t2 gyrostab, and the rest being cap flux coils.<br />
<br />
Not being the best tanking ship in the world, I normally rely on a bit of speed to avoid fire from most hard hitting ships. However, after being webbed to a complete standstill, I could tank the entire third room with out taking any shield damage a single boost cycle couldn't fix.<br />
<br />
They die pretty easy too.

Easy mission, but don't expect to get rich on it. No bounties, and the salvage / loot only came to 4 mil.

Just completed this.<br />
This was the FIRST level 4 mission I have ever done/gotten. I was scared because i researched this mission before trying it and even let the bonus period slip waiting for corp mates to come from 0.0 to give me a hand as i read about people losing battleships to this mission. HOW!?!? i decided to try solo..  Lol.. i just cheesed this mission in 45mins. Here's my loadout.. oh and in the 2nd room, i got each pocket to come alone without aggroing group 2 etc.. and my drones seemed to bug and fight unlocked targets from 81km.. when they are supposed to limit at 35 ;)<br />
:: 6x dual 180 M AC's  :: 4x t2 LSE :: 1x meta2 Warp Stab ( useless ) :: 1x t2 Gyro :: 4x t2 SPR :: 2x arbalest heavy ass launchers. used standard emp and torrents. 2x t1 infiltarator medium drones, 2x t1 light acolyte drones. :: and uh.. oh yeah.. 4.6m SP.

<span id="comment_4088"></span>I finished this mission in a Myrmidon. If anyone is curious.. I used 200mm compressed railguns. Magnetic vortex stab, Named Webifier, Nonlinear Trac. Stab., Med. Arm. Rep., Explosive and Kinetic hardeners, warp stabilizer. Damage control. All of my Modules are tech I, but they are all named items. For payment I got about 1.7M and I got about 4.9M in loot. I made a total of 6.652M off this mission. Jita prices for loot. Almost lost my 40M ship waiting for 75k worth of hammerheads to return. I will never learn. I found the mission very easy but very time consuming. I am not used to spending 2hrs on a mission although this was my first solo lvl4. Also my last drone mission if I can help it! I have about 3.6M SP but mostly in non combat areas such as learning, marketing, science and engineering. So I don't have the dps or tanking skills most commentors likely have.

Sniping frigate-sized drones with a single volley from 30k+ was a must, lest I have to pull out the Hobgoblins and wait for them to chew at the small ones. Tank wasn't too bad. Don't bother looting the bunker - I got 1 gleaming alloy.

<span id="comment_4639"></span>Okay. Ran this last night with my new, and somewhat experimental LiveStream account recording events. I plan to start regularly recording my missions when i run them, and hope that they will help.<br />
<br />
http://livestre.am/8MeU<br />
<br />
Text can just be read if you fullscreen. Please excuse my habit of surfing/chatting during the mission, and in asploding the structures (I timewaste terribly) - this was just to prove the idea could work, and is really a 1st draft. <br />
Please let me know if the video was informative, crap, whatever, and if you think it is a good idea, Livestream IS free, and they archive your videos for free too. I am looking into finding out how to download them as well.<br />
<br />
Completed in a Nighthawk, 30 minutes because i screwed around, probably 20 if it was a 'clean' run.<br />
Fitting in video.

I see why the mission can be hard, if you get webbed by the 4 drones in pocket 2, you're in trouble. I went from full tank to 20% structure in about a minute and a half. If you sick your drones on them right away, it's a cake walk.

<span id="comment_4989"></span>I accidentally shot group two in the second stage and got stage aggro, so I had to warp out. After warping back in (I waited a while before shooting) I could shoot pretty much everything without them even shooting back, only the last group (not sure which that was originally, but I assume group two) caused the remaining ships to aggro. Also I only had one tackler/webber in that pocket (lucky I guess)...

<span id="comment_5730"></span>Just finished this mission on a Golem, yes it was entirely too easy but that is my mission ship. As far as compounds and alloy drops, original post says 1000m3 of loot. hardly in my case. i salvaged and looted all structures and wrecks and came up with 854m3 no where near the 1000m3 as stated.
