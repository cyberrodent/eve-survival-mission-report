<br />
Faction: Blood Raiders<br />
Mission type: Encounter<br />
Space type: Deadspace, single pocket, no gate<br />
Damage dealt: EM / Therm<br />
Extras: Defender Missiles<br />
Web/scramble: none<br />
Recommended damage dealing: EM / Therm<br />
Recommended ships: CNR, Long-range Laser Battleship<br />
<br />
<h3>Single Pocket</h3>

You warp-in directly to beacon. You can´t warp to optimal range and also no bookmarks possible.<br />
No aggro at warp-in.<br />
Respawn waves will aggro drones.<br />
<br />
<h4>Group 1</h4>

You will find a single Hulk called Illegal Miner(<a class="ext" href="http://games.chruker.dk/eve_online/item.php?type_id=29466">The Incredible Hulk</a>). Destroying it triggers a series of spawns.<br />
Miner will appear about 30km away from warp-in point.<br />
<br />
<h4>Spawn 1</h4>

3x Battleship (Suicide Squad)- Spawn 50km away from warp-in point and will auto target you after a few seconds<br />
They will orbit you at 17-20km<br />
Last killed BS triggers spawn 2<br />
Example of Spawn: 3 x Corpus Patriarch (1,162,500.00 isk ea.)<br />
<br />
<h4>Spawn 2</h4>

4x Battleships (Suicide Squad).  Spawn at 84km from warp-in point, move to range at 48-50km<br />
Last killed BS triggers spawn 3<br />
Example of Spawn: 4 x Corpus Pope (1,218,750.00 isk ea.) (Very low damage until within 50km)<br />
 <br />
<h4>Spawn 3</h4>

4x Battleships (Suicide Squad) Spawn 80km from warp-in point then slowly move to range.<br />
Last killed BS triggers mission completed.<br />
Example of Spawn: 4 x Corpus Pope (1,218,750.00 isk ea.) (Very low damage until within 50km)<br />
<br />
<h5>Tip</h5>

No blitz, no structures, no mineable asteroids<br />

<span id="comment_1024"></span>EM was definately better.  I dealt about 30% higher DPS than therm.  One thing I did notice is the use of NOS and tracking disruptors.  Wasn't much, but it was there.  Also, the there are no bounties but the looted tags were worth 12 million isk.

<span id="comment_1126"></span>BS are named 'Suicide Squad'. Respawn 1 - 52km away. Respawn 2 - 83km away, I killed one of the BS and the other was already at 14km away and started nos'ing me, I think they were microwarping. Last group of BS was 76km away, largest hit on me was 150 from the group and I had 85% em 80% therm armour resist! Blow at least one of the last BS away as fast as you can and it will help.

<span id="comment_1728"></span>This mission was very easy, they do nos, but in an apoc, I was able to kill them before they even got in range.  Loot is fantastic on this mission - 9-15 mil for tags, and the same amount for the mods, lots of BS turrets and Smartbombs; good reprocess.

2x Photon II, 1x Heat II, 3x LSE II, 2x SPR II, 3x CDFP I.<br />
Used Thunderbolts and Hobgoblins for damage.<br />
Just be wary if they start approaching quickly, NOS hurts but if you orbit at 50km or so you won't have an issue. Never had to warp out but it did take a little long.

<br />
Independent Veteran Apocalypse<br />
Independent Veteran Abaddon x2<br />
Independent Veteran Armageddon<br />
<br />
Either the damage output dramatically increased in this mission, my tank was inadequate (doubtful) or my LAR II failed to repair for several cycles as my tank collapsed and my ship exploded. Petition submitted. *Sigh*<br />
<br />
Watch out for this fourth spawn.

<span id="comment_3762"></span>Watch the last spawn the damage output if you get close is very high and can be from a distance. 4 ships with a 3 sec ROF.  The rats were between 72-77km from my ship when this hit came in.  My ship is omni tanked em 69% as the lowest resist. <br />
<br />
20:56:23 Combat Suicide Squad strikes you  perfectly, wrecking for 808.9 damage.<br />
<br />
Be careful with the damage increase this has gone from being a easy bad mission (no bounties or tags) to a terrible mission.

with 2 BS left i was able to tank them with 1 repper, very nasty dps once you get within 50km of them, come prepared

<span id="comment_4113"></span>Ran this mission with a Navy Omen with 5 quad light particle stream lasers navy multi freq crystals, 1600nm tungsten plate, 2Xthermal hard/ 2XEM hard, Damg Cntrl II, Med armr rep. II, 10nm AB II, 2X cap Rechg II,( 2X CCC  1 nano pump rigs) and 5 acolytes II drones.  No Danger with this setup actually easy but boring. No NOS encountered. <br />
1) warp in, destroy miner - respawn group appears 65km away, turn on afterburner and head straight to target you will take some damage from  55km to about 25 km my armor dropped to 62% with no Repper on. group scatters, destroy target(orbit at 3500m with multis) then repeat. loot and salvage consisted of 4 armor plates , 2 melted caps, 1 tachyon laser, and a few worthless odds and ends.<br />
2)If you do this mission in a BC or BS you are slow and and easy target and will take some serious damage. My advice skip this mission as it is NOT worth losing a ship over for the rewards you get. [side note my resist were 88% EM and 88% therm]

<span id="comment_4196"></span>With regards to the above post, if your flying a properly fit mission battleship, tanking any of these groups at any one time should be no/little troubble. I highly doubt a competent missioner would loose a battleship to this mission.<br />
Furthermore, any amarrian battleship, or marauder, with Tachyon beams will effortlessly slice through any and all of the ships in this mission.

<div class="comment">
<span id="comment_4252"></span>I just did this mission; I only observed three waves of battleships (a total of 11 battleship wrecks after the mission was done).  While my measurements of the incoming damage are not certain, any wrecking hits that occurred against me were about 360 damage each on my armor; I had 89% EM and 85% Thermal resistance on my armor (Tech 1 battleship, two Tech 2 hardeners each for EM and thermal).  Rate of fire seemed to be 3 shots per battleship per second.  I therefore estimate the DPS on the last wave to be 320-400 per battleship, before resistances.  Full average DPS would probably be about 1600-2000 damage per second, before resistances (maybe 200-250 damage per second if you use two EM and two thermal armor hardeners).<br />
<br />
Regarding tactics, you don't have to worry about enemy fire until you destroy The Incredible Hulk.  (Yes, &quot;Illegal Miner&quot; is of type &quot;The Incredible Hulk&quot;.)  So, you can afterburn to a sniping position before you destroy the Hulk.  In my case, I was lucky enough for this to cause the battleship spawns to appear very far away from me and was able to weaken the first enemy battleship before it closed to orbit range.  (I was using Curator I drones from a Dominix with an optimal of 72km and falloff of 20km.)<br />
<br />
Regarding fleetmates, you can have one fleet member be the tank for the mission and position the tank between the asteroids and the battleship spawns; your fleetmates can then provide cap transfer or remote shield transfer or remote armor repair (whatever your tank needs) without being shot at by the NPCs.

<span id="comment_4260"></span>I just did this in a cheap t2 fitted Raven, 2x T2 EM and 1x T2 Therm shield hardeners, using T1 Paradise cruises, no drones. Tanking 4 BSs was somewhat difficult but killing them fast makes it average, just remember to let shields and cap recharge before spawning the next group and to aggro quickly after they spawn, and you should be ok.<br />
<br />
All spawn points seems relative to the mission beacon, as soon as I destroyed the first group I started moving forward, and when I was done with the second group, the third and last one spawned behind me at 100km, and didn't aggro - so I easily smashed them from 80km+. They didn't aggro even under 90, so their aggro range must be in the 50-85 km.

<br />
Used a t2 Pulse Paladin with 2x EANM IIs, 1x Em/1x Therm T2 Hardener, a navy armor repairer and 2x tracking comps for extra range. The last spawn dropped my armor at 60% but after I killed one bs, my tank was holding well. Enemies never got nearer than 50km.

Each new spawn appears to warp in at ~70~80km no matter how far you have moved from the warp-in point.<br />
If you're inclined to salvage then bookmarking and fitting a MWD to your salvager will make the job quick and painless despite the distances.<br />
Over 2m in mission rewards, plus about 3m in salvage.

<span id="comment_5490"></span>Just completed in normal Apoc T2 fitted with megas. I dont yet have the skills for scorch and my dps skills are average for BS. First spawns are easy to kite and grind down. Last spawn was at 135K so lots of time to recover cap. My opt range with Radio is 58k so I struggled. At 70K they hit me hard so by the time I was hitting back I was already at half armor. I somehow managed to get down one abaddon which seemed to take forever (no drones for that range.) and warped out as they were rattling my hull.<br />
Whenever I warped back they seemed about 50k and they were doing very hard damage. I had to warp out at least three times.<br />
<br />
If you are a relative noob like myself I recommend you take out the single Apoc first which was twice as easy to damage. The others then become manageable at medium range whilst using drones to finish off.<br />
<br />
The loot was absolute crap so will probably decline this mission until my skills improve. I appreciate some of the guys commenting above are very well skilled and equipped and think this was easy but for a pilot starting out with L4s this is by far the toughest I`ve encountered yet.

<span id="comment_5932"></span>Some additional info:<br />
<br />
First spawn 3x Battleship (Suicide Squad) were all Abaddon type.<br />
<br />
Spawn 2: 4x Battleships (Suicide Squad) were 2 * Abaddon, 1 Armageddon, 1 Apocalypse. <br />
<br />
Spawn 3: 4x Battleships (Suicide Squad) were 2 * Armageddon and 2 * Apocalypse. <br />
<br />
The last spawn did about 110 HP hits at their optimal, with occasional 300 HP Wreckings, which was no problem to tank in my Dominix.

<span id="comment_5957"></span>Had no problems until last spawn, which was 4 Apocs. Had to warp out once. When I came back, they ended up not even attacking me from about 70km out until I got to about 40km, which is within my drone's range. So then I made my drones attack them and they went after my drones, not getting a single hit off on them, and more importantly allowing me to get within AC range and then they went down quickly.<br />
Definitely a shitty mission to do with ACs though, took about an hour.

<span id="comment_6242"></span>This is now a Blood Raiders mission.<br />
<br />
I got the following spawns:<br />
Wave 1: 2x Corpus Pope, 1x Corpus Patriarch<br />
Wave 2: 4x Corpus Pope<br />
Wave 3: 4x Corpus Pope<br />
<br />
Wave 1 spawned at 50km, waves 2 and 3 spawned at 80km.<br />
<br />
Completed easily in a Raven Navy Issue. The Popes were fairly harmless; around 65km they started getting light hits, by which time I had killed 2 out of 4.

<span id="comment_7700"></span>Pro tip, a machariel with 1400's blow the npc's away before they get close enough to do real damage. For me they died in 3 vollies. It's easy and super fast to complete. Pays 13,3 mil in bounties alone and rewards was just over 4 mil.

<span id="comment_8109"></span>Ran this for the first time today in an afterburner\heavy missle Gnosis with 5 Infiltrators. I orbited the targets at 75km for the most part and let the drones do most of the work, moved into missle range if one of the targets got antsy. At less than 50km range with four targets was a bit dangerous, but manageble.
