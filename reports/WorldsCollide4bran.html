Faction: Blood Raiders and Angel Cartel (Blood Raiders in the last pocket)<br />
Mission type: Encounter<br />
Spacetype: Deadspace, with guards at the warp in.<br />
Damage dealt: Em/Therm (very little Kin) from Bloods; All kinds, but heavy EXP/Kin from Angels<br />
Web/scramblers: Elite Frigs, Blood Spy<br />
Extras: NOS (Priest/Dark Priest)<br />
Recommended damage dealing: EM, Therm for the Bloods/ Exp, (Kin 2nd choice) for the Angels.<br />
Recommended ships: Apocalypse, Dominix, Maelstrom, Sacrilege, Nighthawk.<br />
<br />
<h3>Warp in: "Warzone"</h3>

<br />
You arrive in the middle of two large groups (135km to the nearest rat) and two gates (40km to each gate approx). One for your primary enemy, and one for the faction mentioned in the mission briefing (in this case, Blood Raiders and Angels). They start far away from you behind their own gate. The gates are locked until you kill the last ship of that faction.  But, you can unlock them by carrying Zbikoki's Hacker Card (obtained from Zor) in your cargohold. It will be consumed on activation.<br />
<br />
<h5>Group 1 (Blood Raiders)</h5>
 
135 km from warp in<br />
3x Elite Frigate (Elder Corpii Follower / Elder Corpii Herald / Elder Corpii Worshiper / Dark Corpii Upholder)<br />
2x Elite Cruiser (Elder Corpum Dark Priest / Elder Corpum Shadow Sage)<br />
3x Battleship (Corpus Prophet / Corpus Oracle) <strong>Gate Unlock Trigger</strong><br />
<strong>* 400-450dps (EM 51%/TH 49%)</strong><br />
<br />
<h5>Group 2 (Angel Cartel)</h5>
 
135 km from warp in<br />
3x Elite Frigate (Arch Gistii Thug / Arch Gistii Outlaw)<br />
3x Elite Cruiser (Gistum Domination Crusher / Gistum Domination Smasher)<br />
4x Battleship (Gist Malakim / Gist Throne) <strong>Gate Unlock Trigger</strong><br />
<strong>* ~600dps (EM 1%/EX 78%/KN 18%/TH 2%)</strong><br />
<br />
<h5>Tip</h5>

<ul><li> If you can't build a strong enough omni-tank based on the information provided, I'd suggest tanking EM/TH first and take the mission to completion, and then come back with your Angel Cartel tank before turning the mission in.
</li><li> Both Groups are "anchored" to within about 30km of their start locations, which are about 85 to 95 km behind their gate.  This makes it easy to snipe them from the far edge of the gate if you can lock and hit from that far out.  Neither group can hit you from 55km.</li></ul>
<br />
<h3>Blood Raider Pocket</h3>

<br />
Blood Spys might scramble/web, but may not also.  Using drones on them aggros the whole room.<br />
<br />
<h5>Group 1: 7km</h5>
 
Aggro at warp in<br />
2x Frigates (Blood Spy)<br />
3x Battleships (Corpus Apostle / Corpus Oracle)<br />
<br />
<h5>Group 2: 23km</h5>
 
2x Battlecruiser (Corpatis Fanatic)<br />
2x Battleships (Corpus Apostle / Corpus Oracle)<br />
can be attacked seperately<br />
<br />
<h5>Group 3: 24km</h5>
 
5x Destroyers (Corpior Friar)<br />
5x Battleships (Corpus Apostle / Corpus Oracle)<br />
<br />
<h5>Group 4: 7km</h5>

1x Battleship (Blood Rider Supervisor)<br />
<br />
Random chance of a Blood Overseer [375k Battleship] spawning.  It can be attacked separately without agroing other groups.  Every ship that enters the pocket gives the Overseer another chance to spawn.<br />
<br />
Warning:  if you do it all wrong and aggro all of them -- <br />
<strong>* Full-aggro is 1100-1200dps (EM 50%/TH 50%) with the occasional kinetic cruise missile from the BS's.</strong><br />
<br />
<h5>Tips:</h5>

<ul><li> <em>Shooting the Spies with your own guns/missiles will not aggro anything else. Drones and anyone else will.</em>
</li><li> Drones can be safely used to kill the auto-aggro group. Just make sure they don't shoot Spies.
</li><li> One can slowboat to the next gate. No additional aggro. You will be at around 5 km to the gate when the gate group aggros you.
</li><li> Wait for the 1st group to target you, and take them all out.  Fire on another ship, it's group will target you, and take that group out.  Feel free to take out the Blood Spy's, once the 2nd group is gone, to trigger the last group.
</li><li> you might find a collidable structure in your way (or even hit it) as you enter.</li></ul>
<br />
<h3>Angel Cartel Pocket</h3>

<br />
Tank: Exp / Kin<br />
Aggro at warp in: Yes (might web too)<br />
<br />
Four apparent groups as of April 2011.<br />
<br />
<h5>Group 1: 7km</h5>
 
Aggro at warp in<br />
2x Frigates (Angel Spy) <strong>(Web/Scramble)</strong><br />
3x Battleships (Apostle/Oracle)<br />
<br />
<h5>Group 2: 20km</h5>
 
4x Frigates (Gist Viper) <strong>(Web)</strong><br />
2x Cruiser (Gist Primus)<br />
3x Battleships (Gist Saint) <br />
<br />
<h5>Group 3: 35km</h5>
 
3x Elite Frigates (Arch Gist Hunter/Impaler)<br />
1x Elite Battlecruiser (Arch Gist Centurion)<br />
4x Battleships (Saint/Warlord)<br />
<br />
<h5>Group 4: 50km</h5>
 
5x Battleships (Gist Throne/Cherubim)<br />
<br />
<h5>Tips:</h5>

<ul><li> Using drones on the Spies causes the whole room to aggro.
</li><li> The Saints throw Bane torpedoes and can hit at 55km or more.
</li><li> Arch Gistum Centurion is fast and will close the range to under 20km, so kill before the Saints.
</li><li> Cherubim throw Havoc cruise missiles to at least 80km.  Thrones are shorter range.
</li><li> Chance of spawning a Gist Overlord [543k battleship] as well.  Chance increases with every ship that enters the room.  Overlord waits to be attacked, and attacking it caused the remainder of the room to aggro.</li></ul>
<br />
<em>Untested:  A second ship (gangmate) present may cause entire room to aggro immediately.</em><br />
Original player leaving to get more ammo and returning does not cause remaining groups to aggro.<br />
<br />
<br />
<h3>3rd Pocket (Blood Raiders)</h3>

<br />
<strong>*VIP:  Killing all the ships in the 3rd pocket trips the "mission completed" flag even IF you do NOT pick up the stranded crew.  </strong>*<br />
{Ie:  If you kill them all, and fail to pick up the crew, you will have to quit the mission with loss of standings from agent, corp, and faction.}<br />
<br />
The pocket looks like a single group, but it's actually 3.  Use the same technique suggested for the Blood Raider pocket.<br />
<br />
<h5>Group 1: 5km</h5>
 
Aggro at warp in<br />
3x Elite Battlecruisers (Elder Corpum Dark Priest / Elder Corpum Shadow Sage)<br />
2x Battleships (Corpus Apostle / Corpus Oracle / Coprus Prophet)<br />
They won't move very fast, so you can get some range on them if you can find a direction to go that doesn't come close to other groups.<br />
<br />
<h5>Group 2: 10km</h5>
 
4x Elite Frigates (Elder Corpii Herald / Dark Corpii Upholder) <strong>(Web/Scramble)</strong><br />
2x Battleship (Coprus Apostle / Coprus Oracle)<br />
can be attacked seperately<br />
<br />
<h5>Group 3: 10km</h5>
 
3x Battlecruiser (Corpatis Fanatic / Corpatis Phantom)<br />
2x Battleship (Coprus Apostle / Coprus Oracle / Coprus Prophet)<br />
<br />
Again, if you do everything wrong [use drones, etc.]<br />
<strong>* Full-aggro is 900-950dps (EM 51%/TH 49%) with the occasional kinetic cruise missile from the BS's.</strong><br />
<br />
<h5>Tip:</h5>

<ul><li> Only need to blow up the auto-aggro group to get the ship crew.
</li><li> Keep drones on Passive to prevent any unwanted aggro
</li><li> On occasion, you might - even without drones or partners - aggro all of the groups (some of which can warp scramble). I suggest you put some distance fast between u and the groups you haven't yet aggroed.</li></ul>

<span id="comment_125"></span>To omni-tank the whole mission, I used the same setup I use for Enemies Abound - Part 5.  Maelstrom perma-tanked with T2 XLSB, T2 SB Amp, 2x T2 Invuln. Fields.  I have Minmatar BS 5 and almost maxed cap skills, so take my comment with a grain of salt...

setting drones on angel spy results in them getting agro from other groups. Pulled drones back in, then shot spy with cruises: no additional agro at all. So safe to take the spies out with your own weapons.

<br />
If you sit just off the acceleration gate, you can shoot the groups from afar without taking damage.  I was about 47+ km from the group without getting hit.  Sending drones will get aggro from the frigs.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Angel Pocket:<br />
Shooting angel Spies does not aggro other groups.  Drones do, however.<br />
<br />
Took out spies with my Drake, and came back to deal with everything else in my Raven.  Found a Angel overseer in the group of battleships.

<span id="comment_3989"></span>Gist Saints in the angel pocket do 80% thermal damage, 20% kinetic.  Needs to be mentioned. Almost got eated because I had fitted for Explosive resists and got ganged up on by a bunch of them.  Several of the other battleships were also heavy on thermal and kinetic too.  Funny thing is that they were throwing cruise missles and torpedos (both explosive) at me at the same time as they were shooting me.

<span id="comment_5100"></span>For Blood raider pocket, not only drones can aggro whole pocket on them. My friend just disappeared when he's tried to attack blood spies on his cruiser. For low damage skill but well tanked ship (e.g. Drake) you may also prefer to kill other ships until you can attack spies with drones or friends safely.

<span id="comment_5926"></span>The worst on this mission are the travel ways in the warzone stage. Blood Raider pocket I just ignored the spies and killed group after group with cruises and garde II. No room aggro. Same applies for the other two rooms. <br />
<br />
Updated the formatting like seen at serpentis/guristas and added some km values.

<span id="comment_5993"></span>When you take a friend with you into the angel pocket, be sure that he/she doesn't attack the 2 small frigates aswell, next to drones, this will aggro the whole room.<br />
<br />
Bringing a friend into the room will not automatically aggro the whole room.<br />
I am not sure what happens when a friend of you attacks any other ship, because we had to get the hell out of there :-P

<br />
Was aggro'ed by two groups in the 3rd pocket rather than the usual one. The four Upholder Frigates in the second group have the ability to both warp scramble and web you.<br />

Fair warning for anyone attempting to retry this stunt..

<span id="comment_6981"></span>Just completed this mission. First time doing Blood Raiders version. After the previous comment I was very worried about my tengu. I finished the mission without going below 95% shields. The spies took a hell of a beating from my precision missiles before going down. 3rd pocket I ran away going straight up as I did in the second pocket. Saved the 4 frigs for last. 3 webbed me and one scrambled me but they had a combined dps of close to 0. Extremely easy. I only shot at who aggroed me, Frigate first. This mission may have changed or may have random aggroing so (as said before) take this comment with a grain of salt.
