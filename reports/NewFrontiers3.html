<em>Bring mining modules or drones to mine the Green Arisite roid.</em><br />
- Note: You must mine the Green Arisite yourself. Buying it from someone will not be adequate to complete the mission.<br />
<br />
<h5>Blitz</h5>

Mine the Green Arisite and leave. Be careful when approaching the Green Arisite roid not to close since they'll aggro.<br />
<br />
<h5>Tips</h5>

<ul><li> The 3 Merc Miners will disappear after a certain time so if you want to kill them, target them first. They drop drugs when killed. Attacking the Miners spawns the 2nd wave of ships.
</li><li> The 5th and 6th waves of ships may not spawn (all missions are slightly randomised).
</li><li> There are also approx 16433 units of Omber, 591937 units of Veldspar and 1995 units of Gneiss to be mined.
</li><li> To find the Green Arisite, add Gneiss to your overview.	
</li><li> IT is possible to get hauler spawns that drop 40k Pyerite or the like</li></ul>

2x Drone Battlecruiser (Enforcer Alvatis)<br />
2x Drone Cruiser (Disintegrator Alvum)<br />
<br />
After few minutes, the Battleship Drone will spawn (Alvus Ruler, Supreme Alvus Parasite, possibly others). It has high damage, even at 50km, so be careful. As you shoot the BS, another group of drones (Wave 7) will spawn.<br />
<br />
<h5>Blitz</h5>

Go in passive tanked, ignore all sentries and neut towers.  While waiting for the BS, kill off the first spawn.  Wait for the BS to come out of the range of the stasis towers (you won't have cap to tractor the loot can), then go for it, pick up the can, finito.<br />
<br />
<h5>Alternative Blitz</h5>

Go in passive tanked, but kill the Stasis Towers early. There's plenty of time to take care of the triggered Strain spawn before the BS drone with the mission loot spawns, and this way you can attack it earlier (while still closer to the structures).<br />
<br />
<h5>Tip</h5>

<ul><li> Smartbombs are a good idea again.
</li><li> Stay out of the range of the stasis towers.
</li><li> It is best to go for passive tanking and take the towers one by one (starting with the energy neutralizers). Destroy each spawn before continuing to the next tower.
</li><li> If you are active tanked, then: primary the energy neutralizers, kill each spawn as it arrives and before proceeding to the next tower. Primary Strain drones (scramblers), and then the Violator Drones as they do the most damage.

<span id="comment_28"></span>From Kesper North:<br />
<br />
I wanted to say, though, that I disagree somewhat with the sequence of primary targets recommended for New Frontiers pt. 5.  The guide says to make the energy neutralizer towers your primary, then to pick off the Strain drones. However, doing it this way just resulted in me getting killed -- by the time I destroyed all the towers, the Strain drones were on me and I was scrammed. I actually lost several Ravens and ended up quitting this mission twice before I figured out the trick (for me at least):<br />
<br />
Each e-neut tower spawns 3 or 4 Strain drones when it is destroyed. The safest way to finish the mission is to destroy 1 neut tower, then destroy the strain drones it spawns when it dies. Otherwise you end up scrammed before you can destroy all the towers, and if you use an active tank you're screwed.<br />
<br />
Of course this means that if your weapons depend on cap to fire, you're hosed (unless you use cap injectors, natch). So this strategy may be best recommended for Caldari, since our missiles don't use cap. Still, I think it's the best, safest (and so far only) way I've found to solo New Frontiers 5.

<div class="comment">
<span id="comment_79"></span>New Frontiers 5 is and always has been the most unpleasant Level 3 mission for me. It has all: massive damage, lots of scramblers, heavy neut towers, fast ships flying towards you sneakily increasing the damage, lag risk due to structures in the mission and 30-40 enemies at one time. As far as I recall, I did this mission four or five times, each time differently (twice in an unrigged Drake with a cap injector) and multiple warpouts. It is very tricky and needs some planning. <br />
<br />
Using the drake with active hardeners I flew towards the towers first and stayed at 59km range, because my heavy missiles didn't shoot farther. Then warpout before the scramblers come in range, refill the cap, get back in, kill the scrams first and then everything else. <br />
<br />
A Raven flying away from the site should be able to take out the towers quickly (they have 110km range), and even with a cap damaged active tank it should be able to finish all the drones off (making use of the cruise missile range and the drones once you got full aggro). <br />
<br />
New Frontiers 7 has also pretty massive damage and a BS with massaggro of 30+ ships in room2, but it's nowhere near malicious as NF5.<br />
<br />
On a sidenote: the Dominix of a friend was able to tank full stage aggro in NF5 and NF7 without any problems. But the Domi can tank anything, so...

<div class="comment">
<span id="comment_290"></span>Here's a very easy way to do the 5th part (it's actually the easiest if done this way)<br />
<br />
After you warp in, fly away from the neut towers and don't do anything. Wait for the mother drone to spawn. It will follow you.<br />
Once it is about 50km away from the neut towers, turn around and burn towards the mother drone while shooting it with everything you have (haven't tried it with drones)<br />
<br />
Once it is dead, scoop the mission objective from the mother drone's wreck and fly home.<br />
<br />
Note:<br />
<br />
-Take a cap injector and cap charges with you if your guns need cap, you will be neuted dead by the time the mother drone spawns.<br />
-This way this mission can be done in a cruiser probably. No need for uber fancy and expensive battleships.

<div class="comment">
<span id="comment_876"></span>On part 4 of 7 - I did this in a mostly passive tanked drake, I did have a rainbow cloak turned on - so I had plenty of time to write down what happened.  yawn. Never got more than 30% taken off the shields.  <br />
<br />
Warped in, and the drone BS plus 3 light missile batteries were the only NPC in the room.  I fired on a missile battery and this spawned:<br />
<br />
3x Violator cruisers<br />
4x Splinter (frigs?)<br />
2x Decimator<br />
3x Infestor<br />
<br />
I then got 6 more waves. Wave's 1-3 came in rapid succession, and waves 5-6 came only after I had targeted and damaged the BS.  I waited to take out the BS until waves 1-4 were killed.  I couldn't tell if they were timed spawns or triggered, sorry. :-/<br />
<br />
Wave 1: <br />
2x Ripper<br />
<br />
Wave 2:<br />
2x Maurader<br />
<br />
Wave 3:<br />
3x Violator<br />
<br />
Wave 4:<br />
2x Defeater<br />
1x Annihilator Strain<br />
2x Devastator <br />

2x Strain Sunder<br />
2x Shredder <br />
<br />
Wave 6: <br />
1x Annihilator Strain<br />
2x Hunter<br />

The drone bunker did not drop loot, and I did not take it out until the room was clear.

<span id="comment_992"></span>OLD COMMENTS FROM PART 5:<br />
PeregrinePriscus adds: This mission is actually fairly trivial if done in a Passive tanked drake. 5 Heavy, 2 assault in the high, 3 Shield amps, 3 large shield extenders in the mid, 3 SPRs and 1 BCU in the low, along with two shield extender rigs and a shield power relay rig. When I warped in I focused my heavies on the light missile and stasis towers, and used my light missiles on any frigates that came in range (&lt;36km). I worked over any frigates that came close with the lights, and any destroyers I hit with the heavies. Any pauses I worked on the missile/stasis towers. When the BS spawned, I hit it with the heavies and it went down fairly easily. Right now I'm cleaning up the heavy neut towers one at a time and blasting the spawns before moving to the next. At no time did I drop below 3/4 shielding (18176 shields with 441.76 recharge time).<br />
<br />
JoachimLeHigh adds: This is probably the toughest mission in this series. Because of the neuts, my smartbomb strategy didn't work. I recommend a tachyon fitted apocalypse with a cap-transfer cruiser for support till the neuts are down. I also flew this mission with a passive shield-tanked drake and a blasterthron along with my beam apoc, the drake went in first, then the 'thron and I came in. I worked on the towers while the 'thron popped anything with the name &quot;strain&quot; in it.<br />
<br />
BenThomas adds: Passive tanking is definitely the way to go with this mission. Each time you take out an energy neutraliser various frigs etc. spawn, even in a well tanked battleship if you take out too many energy neutralisers and forget to take out the other ships you could end up struggling a bit. I took out three energy neuts, took out the spawns, then took out the rest of the neuts and the respective spawns. Then worked my way through everything else starting with the strain drones. In a well tanked passive BS you can solo this very easily. For 90% of the mission I had no cap, and my shields never went below 80%.<br />
<br />
CireXinehp adds: completed with a Megathron. I took out all the neuts at range with rails, then came back with the smartbomb trick, then again with rails to take the BS.<br />
<br />
MaobihVanire adds: this is rather easy to do in a Damnation. you can target and hit things at over 90km with 5 missile launchers if you mount a sensor booster 2, so when you come into the mission you can move to greater then 80km hitting the neut towers as you go to that distance and not having to turn on MAR's (the greatest consumer of cap for the damnation, and usually have two). any of the drones that get close can be dealt with via small drones + lasers before they are a threat. once the nos towers are gone you can kite the drones around. Also, I think they have toned down the cap drain, i remember watching cap go to nothing rather fast, and was not a problem this time. as of 2008-08-12

Zaknussem adds: When I did this mission, I saved the Mother Drone for last. Killing it spawned 9 drones over by the Drone Bunkers. I guess that if you kill the Mother Drone first, all the drones in the mission will be spawned.<br />
<br />
JoachimLeHigh adds: I highly recommend a smart-bomb fitted BS for this mission. I flew this in an apoc fitted with 8 large emp smartbombs, flew in, waited for all of the drones to aggro and enter range, then activated all 8. Once I vaped all of the close-range ships, I came in a beam-fitted harbinger to finish off the rest, as well as the mother drone.

<span id="comment_1254"></span>A very simple way of doing Part 5 mission.....Use a CNR<br />
<br />
Fit 2 or 3 Cruise launchers and the rest with Heavies. <br />
2 x invuln 2, 1 magnetic, 1 x thermic, 1 x amp and 1 x xl booster<br />
4 x flux and 1 x bcu<br />
3 x CCC rigs<br />
<br />
You warp in at the 60K mark or so and use cruise to take out the neut towers. After each spawn from a tower kill, they fly towards you slowly....use lights to take out the frigs and meds to take out the cruisers along with your heavies.<br />
<br />
This way, you dont have to move.....they come to you.......and this method ruled out the stasis towers as they cant reach :)<br />
<br />
Just shoot away till theres nothing left.<br />
<br />
NOTES: <br />
* 2 x Cruise takes a while to kill the towers.<br />
* As your in a CNR your shield is extremely large, therefore simple cycling of the booster is all thats required. I never went below 65% shield. <br />
*The neut towers have little effect on cap but taking them out gets the spawns which give compounds which give ISK and adds satisfaction.<br />
*On spare highslot i fit a Drone Link Augmentor I use with caution though as they will be shot at with each new spawn.

<span id="comment_1953"></span>I just completed 5/7 in my Prophecy.  It wasn't a walk in the park, given the three energy neut towers killing my oh-so-precious cap, but it was doable with a lot of warping in/out and heavy reliance on drones.  <br />
<br />
The absolute key for any active tankers should be to kill those neut towers ASAP.  Use whatever means you have to -- long-range guns, drones (with their range boosted by drone link augmentors as necessary), etc.  It's made more complicated by the web towers that slow your advance once you get within 40km or so.<br />
<br />
T2 drones make a huge difference.  I had a mishmash collection of T1 drones I used at first, but they would get picked off one by one, despite my best efforts to try and recall them whenever they started taking fire.  I decided to go and pick up some T2 drones instead, and they made things a lot easier.<br />
<br />
Cap Booster 800s help too.  It really is all about those neut towers.  Knock them out, and the mission becomes pretty easy.

For anything but passive Caldari ships, killing the neut towers first is highly advised.  Just make sure you can kill them quickly, and survive the drone swarm that appears as a result.  Tachyons on the Abaddon was very helpful for killing the towers right away, but had to rely purely on my drones to kill most of the rats (except for some of the larger drones, that orbited further away than the others, which my beams were actually able to hit occassionally).

I fly a drake with 2LSEs, 1 AB, and 3 hardeners in the mids, plus two extender rigs and one anti EM screen rig.  My shield never dropped below 40%.  If you're jumping out before then, you're not giving your tank a chance.  I warped in, started orbiting the neut towers at about 50KM and shot them all down before taking care of the drones that had spawned.  If you stay far enough away, your tank should be fine, even without hardeners running.  Also, I was firing 7 Advance Limos Heavy Missile launchers with standard Thunderbolt missiles.

<span id="comment_6460"></span>I wanted to take a moment to post, for others that might do the part 5 mission and are worried. I completed the mission on my first attempt using a passivly fitted drake, with less then 1mil total SP. So, it is very possible and very easy if done correctly.<br />
<br />
What I did:<br />
<br />
I sat at warp in and waited for the BS to spawn, killing all drone spawns and not touching a single tower. After the BS spawned, I started fling away from the towers (approx. 75km total distance) while killing the remaining drone spawns. I then attacked and killed the BS spawn.<br />
<br />
What this did: <br />
<br />
It allowed me to kill the BS with out having the secondary waves attack from engaging the BS. It also allowed me to engage the BS quicker then trying to fly out of range of the nuet towers, which is 100k+. I was still in range of them, but it was not an issue as none of the new spawns attacked me.<br />
<br />
I hope this helps.

<span id="comment_6910"></span>Might want to add that the Infested Station Ruins in part 7 do not drop anything...despite being a destructible object, so don't waste the couple thousand trauma fury missiles to blow it up....

<span id="comment_7037"></span>Part 6 - Nanite Express   I have done this numerous times with 4 different characters, today for the first time the agent had me routed through Low Sec.  ALSO - (Since the update to INFERNO) none of the drones in this series are giving anything other than bounties, NO Loot and Poor Salvage - my salvage is trained to lvl 5.

<span id="comment_7052"></span>Very fun mission series, good story plot.<br />
<br />
Completed series in T3 Cruiser (Loki), T2/Faction/Deadspace fit - active shield tank with short range weapons and Drones = 5x 425mm II AC's with Barrage/RF EMP ammo, 1x Lg Shield Booster, 2x Shield Boost Amps, 2x Invul Field, 1x 10mn AB, 2x Gyro, 1x Track Enh, 1x PDS, 5x T2 Light Drones - Hobs. Cap Ctrl Circuit (CCC rigs - 2x T2, 1x T1). Sub sys = Tactical Targeting Network, Adaptive Shielding, Capacitor Regeneration Matrix, Projectile Scoping Array, Fuel Catalyst<br />
<br />
All Neut Towers were primary, Stasis Towers were secondary, then worked on NPC spawns starting with Frigs going up. Never lost Cap or tank, never got webbed or warp scrammed by NPC's. Mission looks tougher on paper than it actually is.

<br />
In 1/7, you *must* mine the Green Arisite.  Don't bother trying to buy it from contracts.

<span id="comment_7428"></span>for 1/7 I recommend doing it in a Drake with mining drones. The drones will finish up around the same time that you finish killing stuff.

<span id="comment_7818"></span>Mission 7 the triggers have changed, instead of when killing a previous group / wave, it triggers when you attack that wave. This has happened last three times i've done this mission.<br />
<br />
Have done this mission set (1-7) multiple times in a passive tanked Navy Drake, had no issues with dps of any mission as long as you manage aggro - esp in part 6.

<span id="comment_8124"></span>It is possible to &quot;Blitz&quot; 1/7 by avoiding agro, this information could be made clearer. No kills required, only mining.
