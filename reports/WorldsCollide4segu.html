Video: <a class="ext" href="http://youtu.be/ZakdjTANDcc">http://youtu.be/ZakdjTANDcc</a> , <a class="ext" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gl0FyaR4doQ">Golem</a> , <a class="ext" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-HxvuFgo68">Vargur</a><br />
<br />
<h3>Warp in "Warzone stage"</h3>

<br />
You arrive in the middle of two large groups and two gates. One for your primary enemy, and one for the faction mentioned in the mission briefing (in this case, Serpentis and Gurista). They start far away from you guarding their own gate. The gates are locked until you kill the last ship. But you can unlock them by carrying Zbikoki's Hacker Card (obtained from Zor) in your cargohold. It will be consumed on activation.<br />
The guristas/pith ships will aggro your drones after a while if they haven't aggroed anything else.<br />
The ships are sitting 100km away from their gates, you better have some long range hitting ship or a fast one.<br />
<strong>Do not use heavy drones! Rats will switch aggro to drones.</strong><br />
<br />
<h5>The overseer:</h5>

<ul><li> The overseer is a special ship that will spawn in the first room of each path.
</li><li> The overseer has a value of between 487,500 and 4,875,000 ISK.
</li><li> The higher value one drops faction loot. 
</li><li> The overseer spawn point is with the group that does not aggro at the beginning of the stage.
</li><li> The low value overseer is just like an extra battleship.
</li><li> The high value overseer has a MWD (was moving at about 600 m/s or faster), but has crazy low resists. 
</li><li> It has, in its description, "sometimes they hire a good pilot to fly their ships" and was a dominix model.
</li><li> The highest bounty might drop a Serpentis Blueprint.
</li><li> The overseer doesn't aggro until you shoot it.
</li><li> <em>Doesn't always spawn! (Edit 4-11-2014)</em></li></ul>
<br />
<h4>Serpentis Gate</h4>

4x Frigate (Guardian Veteran) <strong>Web/Scram</strong><br />
4x Battlecruiser (Corelatis Captain Sentry)<br />
4x Battleship (Core Rear Admiral)<br />
<br />
<h4>Guristas Gate</h4>

2x Cruiser (Dire Pithum Eraser/Dire Pithum Abolisher)<br />
3x Battleship (Pith Eliminator/Pith Extinguisher)<br />
<br />
Ships will leash back after 30-40km.<br />
<br />
<h4>Blitz</h4>

- Kill the 4 battleships to unlock gate<br />
<br />
<h3>Serpentis Pocket 1:</h3>

Aggro at warp-in from one group. 4 Groups total. All pretty close and can apply a lot of DPS if full room aggro occurs, which happens sometimes on warp-in. Guardian Veterans may web and scramble. Battleships in all groups. And there two angel spies in the pocket.<br />
<br />
<h5>Group 1:  7km</h5>
  
Aggro at warp in<br />
3x Frigate (Guardian Veteran) <strong>Web/Scram</strong><br />
1x Battlecruiser (Corelatis Captain Sentry)<br />
2x Battleship (Core Rear Admiral/Core Flotilla Admiral)<br />
<br />
<h5>Group 2: 25km</h5>
 
Aggro at warp in<br />
1x Cruiser (Angel Spy)<br />
<br />
<h5>Group 3: 25-30km</h5>

2x Frigate (Guardian Veteran) <strong>Web/Scram</strong><br />
4x Battleship (Core Commadore/Core Baron)<br />
<br />
<h5>Group 4: 25-30km</h5>
 
Bottom Group<br />
3x Frigate (Guardian Veteran) <strong>Web/Scram</strong><br />
1x Battlecruiser (Corelatis High Captain)<br />
3x Battleship (Core Rear Admiral/Core Port Admiral)<br />
If drones get aggro, recalling them seems to reset this group.<br />
<br />
<h5>Group 5: 25km</h5>

1x Battleship (Overseer, see above) <strong>Jamming</strong><br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<h5>Structure:</h5>
 Serprentis Stonghold drops assorted ammo and modules. Note Lots of HP 
<br />
<br />
<h3>Gurista Pocket 1:</h3>

<br />
<h5>Group 1: gate 20-30km</h5>

3x Frigate (Pithi Invader) <strong>Web/Scram</strong><br />
4x Cruiser (Pithum Eraser)<br />
<br />
<h5>Group 2: Broken Orange Crystal Asteroid 20-30km</h5>

2x Battleship (Pith Eliminator/Exterminator/Massacrer/Ursuper/Extinguisher)<br />
2x Cruiser (Pithum Eraser)<br />
<br />
<h5>Group 3: Open Space 20-30km</h5>

5x Battleship (Pith Eliminator/Exterminator/Massacrer/Ursuper/Extinguisher)<br />
3x Frigate (Pithi Invader) <strong>Web/Scram</strong><br />
<br />
<h5>Group 5: 25km</h5>

1x Battleship (Overseer, see above) <strong>Jamming</strong><br />
<br />
Distribution within the 3 groups not yet perfect. Haven't had time to sit back, relax and write it all down perfectly. Will do shortly.<br />
<br />
Aggro from one. For me when i did shoot the aggroing group (group 3), group 2 did aggro as well. A single sansha's demon is also spotted.<br />
<br />
The ships will aggro other gang members when they arrive.<br />
<br />
The gate will go to the Serpentis Pocket 2.<br />
<br />
Gamtu discovered: The station in the Gurista pocket dropped loot once. Basic t1 stuff.<br />
<br />
<h3>Serpentis Pocket 2: (Crash site)</h3>

You will stop in the middle of 4 groups. Great for short range weapons. No web/scramblers. Aggro from one group. If you shoot only the aggroed Group, you won't get stageaggro. After finishing the first group take a NPC near the gate and you will get aggro from the next group and so on. There's a damaged Heron in the middle as a spawn container. Open it, and grab 20 "ships crew" when you have destroyed close to everything.<br />
<strong>In my case final room (Crash site) has guristas pirates that jamed me alot :)</strong><br />
<br />
<h5>Group 1: 5km</h5>
 
Aggro at warp in<br />
3x Battlecruiser (Corelatis High Captain/Corelatis Captain Sentry)<br />
3x Battleship (Core Rear Admiral)<br />
<br />
<h5>Group 2: 5-10km</h5>
 
Distance aggro under 5km<br />
3x Battleship (Core Rear Admiral/Core Vice Admiral/Core Flotilla Admiral) <strong>Sensor Damp</strong><br />
<br />
<h5>Group 3: 5-10km</h5>
 
Distance aggro under 5km<br />
3x Battlecruiser (Corelatis Squad Leader/Corelatis Wing Leader)<br />
1x Battleship (Core Vice Admiral) <strong>Sensor Damp</strong><br />
<br />
<h5>Group 4: 5-10km</h5>
 
Distance aggro under 5km<br />
3x Destroyer (Corelior Trooper/Corelior Soldier)<br />
2x Battleship (Core Commadore/Core Port Admiral)<br />
<br />
"Gate to the warzone" leads back to the Warzone stage.<br />
<br />
<h5>Blitz</h5>

The only group you need to destroy to "unlock" the Heron is the one that spawns first. It consists of one Core Flotilla Admiral, two Core Rear Admirals and three Corelatis Captain Sentries. When the last ship belonging to that group is destroyed, the journal button flashes. You can then grab the crew from the Heron and leave.<br />
None of the other groups that spawn soon afterwards aggro, and neither do they object to drones.<br />
<br />
<h5>Bounty</h5>

26,700,000.00 (full clear, both paths)<br />
<br />
<h5>Video</h5>

<span id="comment_323"></span>Another note for Serpentis Pocket 2: I flew away from the gate initially and started killing the group shooting me when the others were at about 35 km or so (not getting any more aggro). I then reapproached the heron to loot it and started shooting the other groups. Even though I was smack in the middle of them all I never had more than 1 group aggro me at once. No idea if they changed it or the flying away at the beginning removes the aggro-threat...

Tank wise. 2xkin 2xtherm 1 LARt2 will be more than enough.<br />
Bring medium or small drones for frigs.

<span id="comment_1368"></span>took like 20-30 mins to clean just the serpentis on the first pocket because i was testing Wardens I dps. when i warped to the serpentis pocket 1 i found out that the overseer spawned just after the last wave on that pocket spawned, pity it was a low-end overseer.

<span id="comment_2795"></span>Done this mission today. Encounter some exp damage (piranha light missiles) in Gurista pocket. Have'nt been scrammed in Gurista pocket. I suggest using light drones as my med Hammer II and Vespas II had difficult time blowing up the serp frigs. As in WC vs Angels and Sanshas, I left the Spy frigates alone, so my drones don't get aggroed.

<br />
Long (about 1h30m) mission, if you want to kill all pirates. Only had to warpout once, because drones were on agressive and attacked the Guristas Spy (which aggros the entire room). Somewhat easy, if you don't shoot the spy on the 2nd rooms.<br />
<br />
About 24M isks of bounties/rewards, 2000m3 of loot, circuit boards/armor plates/ward consoles as salvage (~40m of salvage time).

<span id="comment_5051"></span>For some reason I got full Serpentis pocket aggro at warp in, before firing a single shot. The DPS was quite intense.

Was webbed by 4 of them scrammed by 2. First time my DNI tank has been broke, had to warp out and come back.

<span id="comment_5166"></span>Mission is easy mode in a NIghthawk with 1x kin, 1x therm, 1x invuln. About 26M in bounties fully cleared. Takes about 5-15 minutes to clear a pocket depending on setup and etc.<br />
<br />
Would assume Tengu is even quicker.

<span id="comment_5363"></span>Some additional comments on my previous post:<br />
<br />
- It looks like there's a bug: the Serpentis Spy may or may not spawn. If it doesn't then you get the full Serpentis pocket aggro.<br />
If this is the case it's best to leave the mission immediately unless you have the gear and the skills to deal with huge DPS.<br />
I survived with a Maelstrom with 2 x T2 Kin + 1 x T2 Therm hardener, cap booster 800 and Pith A-Type X-Large SB. Had to use all the charges. At the time I did not have Thermodynamics, else it'd be easier.<br />
<br />
- The Overseer can also come in Navy Mega shape. His description is: &quot;The Angel Cartel profits enough from its protection deal with the Serpentis Corporation for it to send its best and brightest pilots on guarding duty.&quot;

- The Overseer will spawn even if you don't warp in / out etc. He may spawn 15 minutes or so after you shoot at stuff in the first room (the one with both faction gates), I could enter in the Serp Room and find him there already.

<span id="comment_5420"></span>Def. a full aggro possibility now on both Gur and Serp pockets, and I observed the spies spawn in each, so it is not dependent on the spies failing to spawn. Full aggro on attacking one of the 3 initially attacking veterans on serp side.

<span id="comment_5938"></span>Got aggro from 3 groups in serpentis pocket 1, had 4 battleships and 5 webifiers on me at once, in addition to some cruisers. I quickly warped my raven out but my shields went from halfway to almost depleted in just the time it took to enter warp, while my X-large shield booster was running the whole time. Insane DPS, didn't do anything to get aggro.

<span id="comment_6288"></span>I think the recent changes with NPC jamming have made the Guristas more difficult. With a LADAR strength of 23.1 on my marauder (courtesy of two backup T2 arrays), I still got jammed a lot.

<span id="comment_6574"></span>Just run the mission. Made Guristas room first, didnt move my navy mega, shoot the ones shooting at me, fired at one ship at the time at killed the ones shooting me. Made exactly the same in the Serpentis Room. In any room I got full agro, just 3/4 ships at the time. Took me 1h and 10m to kill everything and didnt got any of the overseers.<br />

<span id="comment_6797"></span>Has something changed to this mission? It was one of my favourite ones to do. I usually run this with 2x Therm hardeners and 1x Kin (armor). I had an Imperial Navy LAR before and did it fine. I have since bought a Core X-Type and I was getting RAPED in the serps room. I even had to warp out which has NEVER happened before. I decided to add an extra hardener so I have 2x Kin, 2x Therm and I still get to like 10% armor and almost 0 cap. Wtf... Oh and I forgot to mention this time I ran it with my alt boosting, so I have an extra 10% armor + shield and I still get hurt BAD. Never ran it with him before. Seriously wtf is up with this mission?!
