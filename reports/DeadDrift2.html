<span id="comment_5507"></span>You get a transmission on warp in to help a ship (Armageddon) near the WH. The ship is about 20km away. Flying there will trigger a wave of Mercenary frigs and BC. After a while a secound wave arrives. After shouting down the first BC, a Machariel BS spawns ~5km distance. (bounty:750.000 ISK) Some time later a secound Machariel BS spawns.

<br />
Not sure if this is because the rescued scientists were delivered to the Splendor before all of wave1 went down.

<span id="comment_5742"></span>Gave it a try in a Drake, with success. I've been playing for 3 months so my skills are not good.<br />
<br />
Used 3 Large Ext Shield T2, 2 Invul T1, 2 Shield Power Relays, 6 named Heavy Missile Launchers with standard ammo, and a Standard Missile Launcher charged with Defender missiles to reduce damage. Shields never got below 50%.<br />
<br />
Key is to kill the webbing drone.

<span id="comment_5943"></span>Just did this with a 2 mil toon in a firetail, there seems to be no mention of the damage pulses which might come from the wormhole. I received 2 waves of damage, the first took me to 30% shield, so I just sat unmoving for the shield to rep and then headed to the ship to rescue which seemed to trigger another damage wave which took me into half armour. After this wave the first enemy ship wave turned up and I hightailed it out of there. I hope I get this mission again, i would like to try it in a rupture and see what happens then with regards to the damage waves.

Mission just says complete after approaching the frigate. There is no Armageddon and there are no spawns.

<span id="comment_6285"></span>very easy mission to complete, very hard to clear all the encounters due to the deadspace pocket location not to mention the drones, should be fairly easy to clear if you can manage to destroy the webbing drones, but since you don't need it to finish the mission so don't bother, unless you have a decent amount of skills and flying a proper ship like drake or mael.

<span id="comment_6799"></span>28th of Jan 2012<br />
Just did this mission and other than the previous times I've completed this mission, it wasn't justs about flying in, waiting and flying out anymore.<br />
I had to approach the unmarked battleship, grab the 5 scientists which are in it and then bring those 5 to the wreck of the Splendor. Of course all the above mentioned spawn waves, including the battleship, happily fired at me while I moved my webbed a...fterburner to the wreck. It completed after dropping the scientists in the wreck but first it spawned some more enemies on top of me. So careful, might be harder than expected!

<span id="comment_6828"></span>Just ran this mission in a Gila.  Confirming that you must appraoch the 'Geddon, take the scientists from its wreck (will be in a normal can), and drop them into the Splendor (mission container).  I destroyed all spawns, and my shield never dropped below 90%.  Granted I was using a Gila, but as long as people use the normal tanking and damage strategies for Mercs (tank for therm/kin, and do therm damage), and try to take out the web drone first, then a standard battlecruiser should be just fine for this mission, even with lower skills.

Approach the Armageddon and take the 5 scientists from it then head to the Splendor Frigate to place them in it. (Only do this if you can tank the damage. (When you've approached the Armageddon you will trigger the first wave of rats, when this happens look for the &quot;Webber Drone&quot; and attack it while on the way to the Splendor Frig. If you have drones wait till all the rats have you targeted before launching your drones to help in killing the Web Drone. Once the 5 scientists are in the Splendor Frig you can complete this mission)).

<span id="comment_6907"></span>there is no need to reject this mission if u are the new player.<br />
i done it on t1 cruiser, with basic recommended skills. <br />
in the first, u should get 5 Scientists (not from mission generated cargo) u may found them in contracts and buy.<br />
after that warp into the needed dead space, and get close to the damaged ship, drifting to an anomaly. it will cause to summon the 1st wave, but DON'T pick up the scientists from oberon's wreck (if u not want to catch all the waves in one time). then kill the spider drone, that webbing u. (i've been used the medium short range turrets + stasis webfiber for that) <br />
so u may need to warp out at the nearest station to repair armor and recharge shield and cap once or twice.<br />
when the spider drone is dead, just pick down ur own scientist in a splendor wreck. that will complete the mission. <br />
also u can save the coordinates and back there after pass this mission to an agent, they may needs u in future. <br />
p.s. sorry for my invalid english :)
