<br />
You warp in roughly 75-90km from the rats, which all aggro immediately except for the sentry, presumably because it's out of range. Angel Vipers/Webifier close in pretty fast, other frigs are a little slower. There are no triggers or respawns reported.<br />

<br />
<br />
<h5>Structures</h5>

Battlestation drops loot. Be prepared to shoot a long time. (The loot can be generic and unimpressive, and generally not worth it. At 200dps it will take about ten minutes. The explosion, on the other hand, is gigantic.)<br />
<br />
Terzam's Stash drops random generic loot as well<br />
<br />
<h5>Loot</h5>

Loot: ~5,300,000 isk<br />
Bounties: ~5,300,000 isk<br />
Salvage: ~2,500,000 isk<br />
<br />
<br />
<h5>Tip</h5>

Watch out for heavy webbing/scrambling in the bonus stage.<br />
Saint uses Bane torpedoes [explo.] AND some shorter range [45 km?] weapon with thermal damage.<br />
Nephilim does a fair amount of explosive damage using Bane torpedoes<br />
Warlord does a fair amount of explosive damage using Bane torpedoes<br />
<br />

<span id="comment_585"></span>Completed bonus with Dominix. Battleships used bane torpedos.<br />
The frigates that got near enough never webbed or scrambled.<br />
I sent in Warrior II's early to them 60km away.<br />
The battleships will orbit and try to stay away at 33km. <br />
I only had Wasp I's, Garde I's for the bs fight. It took several minutes with the Garde's to take them down. Using the Wasps seemed slightly faster.

<span id="comment_1357"></span>Bonus Room:  in a dominix, I had enough time to kill  the frigates, then warp out. Upon second entry, all 4 battleships were turned into stardust :)  They dont give &quot;great&quot; salvage, but it was enough to be worth roughly 1 million isk. No loot on the battleships through.  I also notice there is no mention of terzams stash.. - I got an Ionic Field Accelerator 1 - worth about 2.5 mill<br />
<br />
Overall the last room was worth roughly 6 Mill isk in value or all items + bounties

<span id="comment_2474"></span>You didn't remove enough from the Main Page. It no longer unlocks the gates to destroy structures. This held true on a number of pockets.And on the last pocket before the bonus level you will save a lot of time and missiles/ammo by warping out and then thru all the gates to the last pocket (b4 the bonus pocket). I would also consider smartbombs to try to get the Webifiers with less than 800 Caldari Navy Cruise missiles. And don't waste your time trekking after those far out cargo containers. For me they just held droppings.

Sure it took a while but wasn't going for isk/hr just fun, trick is to never get caught by webers... orbit at +14km to get the other frig... web's catch you @ 10km... for the spider drones don't worry as they don't do much dmg to u, and rockets work wonders really fast after they stop MWD'n

<span id="comment_4782"></span>I did this in a passive shield tanked Ferox. Hi slots were 3 med pulse lasers and 4 heavy assault launchers.<br />
<br />
In the bonus pocket the elite frigs I got were:<br />
Angel Webifier x1  (short range)<br />
Angel Viper x3  (short range)<br />
Arch Gistii Ambusher x2 (long range)<br />
<br />
The bonus pocket was also 1 Nephilim (700k+) and 3 Warlords (500k+). None of their torpedoes did much damage to my battlecruiser, probably because it's too small to be effectively hit by torpedoes. That's something to keep in mind if you want to use a smaller ship to destroy battleships. I had 3 small/med drones I used to destroy the frigates, along with some inefficient turret/missile attacks.<br />
<br />
Got a meta 1 passive armor hardener from the stash.

<span id="comment_4790"></span>Why are all these ppl running a lvl 3 Bonus Room in a Battleship. Why not just run 4's, so much more ISK/Hour, what a waste of time :-/. As for me, I was in a Pulse Harby. Very easy as most ships orbit very close.

<span id="comment_5026"></span>I bought a Angel Palladium tag for 1.5M so I could get to the bonus room. The bounties already where about 3 M, hehe.<br />
<br />
I was sweating a little bit with my Hurricane with t2 modules and t1 missiles and t1.5 auto cannons. But it was easy to get within 1k range of the bs and then it was sit back and relax.<br />
<br />
I love how the explosions of the torpedo's look like! Was a great fight. Can not wait until my BS is ready for lvl 4 missions.

<span id="comment_5406"></span>Lot of webbing close range frigs, make sure you have good tracking or drones that can take care of them. None of the structures were killable, 0 dmg hits, not sure what is going on there, has the encounter changed or something?<br />
<br />
Fairly easy time in my Brutix, killed frigs from range before they were able to start orbiting, the rest is easily tanked with an armor rep II and proper resists.

<br />
It's also worth noting that you don't need to kill the battleships to access terzam's stash (just the frigates).

<span id="comment_7920"></span>Did this in a Vexor, armor tanked. Except the bonus room: those 4xBS did too much damage to my poor little Vex. I couldn't hurt them as much as they hurt me. I warped out once to tank, went back in, took one BS out, but had too much dmg to take and costed me too much ammo.<br />
<br />
Armor fit: Reactive Armor Hardener (skill: Armor Resistant Phasing III or more), Protoype energized armor layering Membrane, Medium automated carapace restoration +2 prototype armor hardeners (mission specific damage).<br />
<br />
Drones: 5x Hobgoblin II<br />
<br />
Experimental 10MN AB, turn this on, you need this speed. However, the medium repper unit will take a lot of cap, turn AB off when using this unit. That's why I fitted 3x Cap Rechargers II, too. I had to use the repper 2x times though, in the last pockets.<br />
<br />
Guns: 4x 200mm Prototype Gauss guns, Guristas Iron charge (or any iron faction charge). These have a falloff range of appr. 67 km.<br />
<br />
Rigs: Medium Ancillary Current Router, Medium Auxiliary Nano Pump, Medium Capacitor Control Unit.<br />
<br />
Stay at a distance of appr. 42km, or drone attack-range (skill specific), use your drones, shoot them rats one by one.<br />
Be careful in pocket 4/5, I recall some spider drones which came up very fast and very close. Let your drones handle them, set your distance, and attack the frigates first (they have speed!).<br />
Got targetpainted, webbed by 2 in pocket 4 and 5. Take them out as fast as you can, you need your speed for the other targets; they can hardly hit you when orbiting with an AB on :)<br />
<br />
I didn't shoot at any structures, no point for me, will cost a lot of ammo. With the bonus room I spend about 1.000 ammo. <br />
<br />
Loot: well...after turning in the mission I went back within 2 minutes, all wrecks were gone except for pocket 5. So loot when you still haven't turned in mission :P My advice at least...

confirming all trigger ships are highest bounty. only exception is pocket 5, wave 1, it is highest bounty cruiser (not frigate).<br />
<br />
generally kept my distance, shields never below 95% (2 ex and 1 kin hardeners).<br />
switched to 2 ex and 2 therm for bonus room. just kited everything and let the drones help out on the little stuff.
