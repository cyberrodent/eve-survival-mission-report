<span id="comment_301"></span>You have to be exceedingly careful with that first room. Get distance! Then take each group separately. The combined aggro of that room is not for everyone.<br />
<br />
Try to keep (tank) those two trigger ships until you have cleared the rest of the room. And watch those other groups! They have a tendency to creep slowly nearer without openly advertising their intend. This makes it especially difficult for your drones. Remember to take out those sensor dampening cruisers. They are evil.

<span id="comment_346"></span>I don't think I ever got though the first stage without getting stage aggro or having to take it manualy to get them off my drones permanently (flying a dominix). It is a lot of DPS though (all in all at least around 1300 or so). If you're using drones you'll have to keep a close eye on them. Group 4 (the 4 BS) usualy starts shooting them if they get too close...

<span id="comment_413"></span>In the first room of this mission I was down to 2 BSes when 6 more rats appeared. 3 frigates and 3 more BSes entered the room and auto-aggroed. I am not positive, but believe that spawn was 3 Gaurdian Spies and 3 Core Admirals.<br />
<br />
I did not notice the discrepancy with this report until looking for tips on room 2. n.b. I did spend a good deal of time 35-40 minutes in this stage before the new spawn arrived.

<span id="comment_748"></span>I should add that that there was an EANM II to round out the low slots and that I have all of the Armor compensation skills at Level IV.  Still, the damage types are accurate and you can fit to jus the damage delivered.

<span id="comment_772"></span>More or less an afk job in Ishtar:<br />
<br />
1 - Start out kiting, take out Guardian frigs.<br />
(1b - Take out Guardian cruisers to cut down damping for step 2, not necessary but reduces the hassle of trying to lock between damping cycles)<br />
<br />
2 - Trigger extra spawn and take out Guardian frigs<br />
(2b - Reel in drones if they take aggro from the new spawn)<br />
<br />
3 - Aggro the rest of the pocket, orbit something at 40km or so with AB on... and after that not much more supervision is required while the drones do their job.<br />
<br />
Pocket 2 is about the same, but seems to be less to worry about in the triggered spawn.<br />
<br />
I run this with one MAR II and two hardeners, so there's two low slots left which there's not much use for when semi-afk and letting the drones to the work... could probably fit for speed and go fast enough to outrun the Guardian frigs as well.

<span id="comment_795"></span>The DPS in the first room is indeed high. I had my tank configured for about 500 dps and I had to warp out once. I did agro all but one group almost immediately, and I do not think there was anything I could do about it. As one person already said, a bunch of ships approach you and then agro you. If I could have managed to agro one or even two groups at a time then it would not have been hard.<br />
<br />
A bunch of battleships in the first room use autocannons, so try to keep your distance. If you can stay 10k+ away from them then you greatly decrease their DPS.<br />
<br />
Nothing scrambled me, so it was no big deal to warp out then come back. I had my droneses take out the frigates ASAP to knock out any potential scramblers. <br />
<br />
I would guess the room is about 800-1,000 DPS if you agro most of the room. Someone said earlier that it is about 1,300 DPS in the first room, and that's probably about right if you agro all groups at once.<br />
<br />
The second and third rooms are a joke.

<span id="comment_850"></span>Having read the comments about the excessive amount of DPS in the first room, I decided to blitz it.  You warp in directly on top of the acceleration gate to the second pocket so so you may as well take it!

<span id="comment_877"></span>If you skip the first room you're walking away from a lot of ISK, there are about 20m worth of bounties on this mission.  Tanked with a Phoon with two large reppers, EANM, two kinetic and one thermal hardener with no problem, ran one repper most of the time and rarely needed two (I am faction fit however).<br />
<br />
In the third pocket the whole room aggro'd me once I took on the closest target.<br />
<br />
Nice mission for bounties and salvage.

Took the groups out in order, theres the random spawn that appears when you pwn a bs. Used dbl therm and kin hards, had to boost once. I only use the drones to take of the little webbing buggers. Job done.

domi cannot tank all of first room (just ran it) while sitting STILL. have your drones pick off the bcs (after scramming frigs) while orbiting the accel gate at 1000m

<span id="comment_1175"></span>On the spawn in the first room - there is a risk of Interceptors packing warp scrams (although not always, I've done it more than once and sometimes no webs/scrams at all) - couple this with poorly managed DPS by getting room aggro before you can handle it and you could put yourself in real trouble.

<span id="comment_2141"></span>Very annoying mission in a Dominix. It is just like that Seven mission where those frigates, no matter how far away you and your targets are from them, ALWAYS aggro on your drones. That mission is so stupid since once you pull them back in the frigs auto warp in a split sec back to their spot (from 10km to you to 140km away it doesnt matter).<br />
I have to constantly pull my Warden II's back in. I AB away from the gate after warping out when two groups at least aggroed after destroying &quot;group 2&quot; with no obvious side aggro.<br />
I hate illogical behavior with NPCs...

Full Clear<br />

Pocket 1<br />
Kill order 1-4-2-3 (group 2 all but trigger BSs)<br />
<br />
Moved behind warp gate 2km and sat, killed group 1 no additional aggro, killed group 4 no additional aggro, killed most of group 2 no additonal aggro. Kind of fell apart after I gained remaining pocket aggro (group 3 + spawn) once I attacked the Trigger Battleships in group 2, should have moved on to group 3 first. At this point my drones also gained aggro from the spawn by attacking the Battleships in group 2.<br />
<br />
Pocket 2<br />
Didn't move, killed group 2 with hobos. No auto-aggro from group 1 until I got within range of the warp gate and deployed sentries, not sure which condition triggered the aggro, or if I was just lucky today, but group 2 aggroed me and group 3 aggroed my drones. Pulled in drones and group 3 de-aggroed and went back to their initial location. Deploying drones again, even different drones, aggroed group 3 on them again.<br />

Pocket 3<br />

<span id="comment_4486"></span>I sadly lost my first CNR to this mission!<br />
<br />
In the mean while i did it like 50 times since.. here's what i know about the first infamous room:<br />
1. getting the aggro from grop 3 alone is easy, their aggro bubble is verry close to the acceleration gate, just move closer , dont shoot anything..<br />
2. shoot a cruiser in group 1 and wait for them to come closer, just wait! - kill them, you wont aggro any other group in this order<br />
3. shoot at something else than battleship in group 2, this will aggro the entire group, but keep drones on passive, touching Core Vice Amiral will trigger a 3 bs, 3 inty : corelly guardian initiate ..spawn, the intys scramble, the BS will do drone like damage.. wich will be a little higher than usual.<br />
4. what is left? ah, group 4, this group shoots drones, whatever you do , dont shoot them, not first , not later, they will aggro everything, leave them for last<br />
<br />
Done in a regular raven with 2 therm hardeners active , and 2 kinetic ones passive :-p<br />
<br />
Important notes: Dont draw aggro by shooting bs, unless you are flying a well tanked smaller ship than bs, shooting BS will have undesired effects!

<span id="comment_5443"></span>Completed in an omnitanked faction/complex fitted Tengu w/ afterburner and 2x Rigor II<br />
Strategy for room 1:<br />
1) Pull full room aggro while flying towards the &quot;middle&quot; of the room<br />
2) Drop a can and start orbiting<br />
3) Kill everything beginning with frigates and ending with the battleships. You will mow them down so fast they can hardly get in range. The battleships take a while to kill simply because there are so many of them.<br />
<br />
Speedtanking works really well against those battleships in room 1 (serpentis in general really). About 5% of their shots actually hit me. The afterburner was also helpful to counter damping (just move closer).<br />
<br />
Entire mission took me 37 minutes to complete.

I switched a cap charger for a medium hull repper and finished the mission while repping my ship with no problems. I think next time ill finish group 4 completely before attacking group 3. <br />

<span id="comment_6734"></span>I've only done this once but agree that attacking group 4 in pocket 1 also aggros group 1.<br />
<br />
It wasn't hard but unless you fit for extreme range and snipe them, be prepared to get up close and personal. I was frequently damped to &lt;20km range and occasionally to &lt;10km. I don't know that I've regularly used my ACs within optimal range unless they charge me but I did doing this mission. <br />
<br />
Note too that although they mostly die fairly comfortably, small ships to Hobgobs/Hammerheads, big ships to guns, the Guardian Chief X ships seem to have t2-type resists and your drones may need a hand.<br />
<br />
Webbing was never an issue for me, but I got scrammed by a couple of frigates. It might have been appreciably nastier with webbing as well, but I could always manoeuvre comfortably.<br />
<br />
Although I don't have a Vaga to try it with, I think it might rip this up - fighting within 10km shouldn't be a challenge for most Vaga fits after all so you'd effectively ignore the damping.

<span id="comment_7256"></span>WARNING !!! I just did this mission and the first is even more dangerous than described:<br />
<br />
Almost every ship uses a sensor dampener on you! I got stripped from 100km locking range down to 16km =&gt; Sniping is totally out of the question. <br />
This means they all will be in firering range before you can shoot back - and that's a lot of DPS (8 BS + full cruiser escort).<br />
<br />
Luckily some of the BS were short-range so they came closer plus I was in a Nightmare - If I had gone in my sniper-Rokh I would have been useless.

I just tried this in my CNR, which is rigged for DPS with Flare I, Rigor Catalyst II and Rigor Catalyst I. <br />
I still found the dps output too low, and had the same dampener problems as the other comments said. To get anywhere with this mish I had to use T2 fury cruise with 2x tp, and kill times were still slow. Vespa II's helped a lot, esp with cruisers. <br />
due to scramblers I recommend kill all frigates first.

VERY NASTY MISSION!<br />
<br />
After reading the mixed messages i decided to test the first pocket in my Maelstrom with a half decent tank. I attacked group 4 which also aggroed group 1. The DPS was high but the damping is insane. My guns were useless as my lock range was 16k, the problem is your locking time is HUGE. I managed to kill the frigs with drones but beware the frigs WILL SWITCH TO YOUR DRONES. I then warped out.<br />
<br />
I swapped to my Vargur and fitted AIF2/TDP2/KDF2/Pith type A SB and a DC2/Signal amp2 in the lows. This made it ok although with a Med capacitor you would walk it.<br />
<br />
Attacking group 4 aggroed group 1.<br />
Attacking group 3 aggroed group 2.<br />
The additional spawn came when i attacked a BS from group 2, nothing when i killed the Bc's (watch for this spawn and take out the frigs ASAP.<br />
<br />
Swap back to a normal fitting for rooms two and three, they are easy. If you have low skills or are not confident dont do the first mission, just blitz to the second room.

<span id="comment_7615"></span>This was a walk in the park in a Deimos.<br />
<br />
I had a couple of Therms and a Kin for hardeners, only needed one repper (at first had another fitted just in case), AB, NOS while shooting, tracking comp with tracking script. For frigs, just dive straight at them, then have your distance button set to, say, 5k and fly straight away to hit them. Ended up pulling drones out only once for frigs, more for extra dps when circling a BS.<br />
<br />
Who cares about dampening when you're flying 2.5k away from your target? And besides, it's fun to tank a dozen battleships in a cruiser.<br />
<br />
I suspect this could be done even in an Ishkur (for fun), fleet stabber, sacrilege (someone mentioned that I see), etc. 92% plus for kin/therm resists makes a Deimos ideal, ofc, but most of the mission I was in shields only.<br />
<br />
If you're worried about your drones, go cheap, use t1 hobs for the risky work.<br />
<br />
Side comment: In room one, I looped around high and behind on group one; it did not aggro another group. Did group three next with no other aggro. Finished the last two central ones together. In spite of the sheer number of ships in room 2, never a worry - just kill smallest to largest.

So the proper way to do it was a sniper Dominix.<br />
<br />
After warp in, quickly (before frigates scram you) use your jump drive to get far enough and deploy Wardens. When they get close (~40km) switch to Gardes. You may have to jump to different positions to do this mission, but it wouldn't take too much time with a 5 sentry Domi potato. Use hybrid turrets for drawing the agro, frigates and battleships WILL attack your drones. Killing frigates and guardian cruisers are priority because these suckers will WEB and SCRAM.<br />
