<br />
<h5>Structures</h5>

No Structures drop loot.<br />
<br />
<h5>Tips</h5>

<ol type="1"><li> Fire on the bottom group to get aggro from 3 groups. Different groups may aggro but the strength is the same.
   Amarr Navy Jakars deal a lot of damage and tank very strongly with EM being the lowest resist at 50%. <br />
   The Sentries will only fire on you if you get close to them (Around 30-40km).<br />
   If you can, kill the frigs while they approach with their MWDs active. <br />
   Otherwise consider: All Interceptors orbit between 3000 m and 6300 m, thus Smartbombs can be used to destroy them quickly, but faction 		   ones (e.g. Imperial Navy Large EMP Smartbomb) are required to eliminate all interceptors. Tech 1 large smartbombs do not have enough for this job. 	 Drones work fine but the number of interceptors in the third pocket is rather high.</li></ol>
<br />
<ol type="1"><li> The mission objective (Amarr Light Marines) is dropped by the last ship of the back group.</li></ol>
<br />
<ol type="1"><li> The proper way to do this mission safely is to attack the LEFT group first, but this is tricky to do unless you have the range to attack 	 them without approaching - the low group has proximity aggro around 50km (?) which means neither you, your buddies or your drones can get too close 
   to them. Anyway, attacking the left group agroes the back group as well, and that group contains the mission objective. Start heading away  with as good speed as you can and downing frigates with guns, and drones when the enemy is beyond agro range of the low group. This is best done with a sniper fit (i.e. able to hit for good damage beyond 50 km). You can then attack the other groups if you want to (or not, to "blitz").<br />
<br />
</li><li> When doing the mission in a Tengu, be sure to kill the Frigs first and be sure to have a decent 10mn AB equiped so you can speedtank most of the larger ships. </li></ol>
<span class="underline"><br />
Standing loss:</span> <br />
  2.4% loss with the Amarr Empire per standing tick (15 minutes). NO loss with the Caldari State.<br />

<span id="comment_931"></span>I completed this in AC/AB Sleipnir, the interceptors with their webbing are annoying, and getting cought by them for too long will be the death of everyone relying only on angular velocity. Drones will kill them fairly effective though, and med AC's gets the job done, but you have to shoot them before they reach you and starts orbiting, so thats tricky, but possible.<br />
<br />
I reccomend Phased Plasma, or that's what I used, and it will melt everything once I'm in range.. I rate this mission medium.

<span id="comment_1913"></span>Important note, it seems that Jakar-only aggro doesn't work anymore. Twice out of the last two times I've done part one, I've gotten full aggro when firing on a Jakar first.<br />
<br />
Fortunately I was able to kill frigs/BSes/Cruisers fast enough before tank fully broke, but maybe I just had really awful luck.

<span id="comment_2395"></span>in part 1, pockets 1 and 2 dump you 20km from nearest ship and there's autoaggro, so fit for close-range damage (dealing and receiving.)<br />
<br />
The last pocket allows you to get as much range as you feel comfortable with. sentry drones &amp; t2 rail snipin make pocket3 a yawn.

<span id="comment_2577"></span>I got this mission, flying in an Armageddon with 4 tech2 specific hardeners and 1 LAR &quot;accomodation&quot;. In first room I had to swap to 2 Kin hardeners to take out the caldari and then I swapped back to 2EM/2Therm for the amarr ships.<br />
<br />
In Pocket 2 I had forgotten my drones so landed right on top of the perma scram/web fighters. Luckily I had a friend who could help me out after I had taken the BS out.<br />
<br />
Pocket 3 (after picking up drones) I first pulled the left group and got bottom+right+back group(jakkar one) and I had to warp out after killing 3 fighters because the kinetic dmg from jakkars were higher than my tank could sustain. I didn't see anything scrambling me so after fitting some more tank (swapped to 2*Therm, 1*Kin, 1*EM and 1* EANM all Tech2) I went back and everything was all over the place so when I after getting to 70kms distance pulled everything came after me and I got horribly pounded and lost my ship because one of the Gamma support fighters scram'ed /blush.<br />
<br />
I went and picked up an apocalypse the day after, fitted 2*therm 1*kin 1*em and 2*LAR &quot;accomodation&quot; with 8 pulses and cleared the last room without any hassle..<br />
<br />
I might've just been unlucky but I'd recommend that if you have to warp out of third pocket make sure you have a proper tank when you warp back in.... Nothing aggros on warpin though so plenty of time to get range but those fighters reach you very fast.

<span id="comment_3124"></span>In Pocket 2 I got 2 Amarr Navy Apocs instead of one Apoc and an Armageddon. interestingly, one of them orbited at about 38-35km, the other got right up to me and orbited at around 6km. <br />
<br />
I had warp scrambling from Delta II supp frigates.<br />
<br />
Also, the Mallers in the last pocket seem to have beastly resists to either Kin, Therm or both. I was doing almost half the damage I usually do.

<span id="comment_3408"></span>Pockets one and two where really easy, no hassle from the frigs (5x hobogoblin T1's killed them rather quick)<br />
<br />
Pocket 3 wasnt really an issue either, only had agro from one or two groups at a time (Left group and the jakkars -&gt; top -&gt; right and left roughly) the thermal drones ripped the frigs apart so the 7 webs didnt bother me. The can dropped from the last jakkar i killed<br />
<br />
Done in a maelstrom, 8x1400mm prototype seige artys. T2 X-large shield booster, EM/therm shield resisters (T2 active) and a invuln T2. (T1 kin rig). T1 shieldbooster and a T2 cap recharger. didnt even need to worry about cap/shield %'s (cap stayed about 50%, got a T1 semiconducter and a CCC)

<span id="comment_3708"></span>Firing on the Jakar aggros everything as of this date, so that's confirmed. Aggro from everything forced a warp-in/kill stuff/warp-out approach until I got the groups down enough to tank.<br />
<br />
Webbers/scrammers are present in that last pocket, so be careful with this one.

Possibly very helpful bug- I had four ships blow up.  Now, that wouldn't really be out of the ordinary...except I didn't even have these ships targetted.  My drones were all on my target.  it's like they just self destructed.  No idea what in the world happened, but they all turned into wrecks for no reason  that I could see.

No real bounties, but lots of tags and good salvaging if you take the time to do it

2) Deploy sentries<br />
3) Tell sentries to pop frigates first, then others<br />
4) If sentries take ~90% damage to shields, scoop to drone bay. (All ships engaging sentries will snap back to their starting locations even if they're on top of you! You will not be targeted.)<br />

<span id="comment_7149"></span>Although a little slow, I completed this in a Myrmidon with dual Med Armor Rep II's. I followed the instructions of carefully choosing targets and pulling them away from the group. Kill the frigates ASAP. The other battleships were pretty much a joke save for the Jakars.<br />
<br />
I would highly recommend warping back and switching your armor resists prior to moving on to pocket 2. I went in with EM, Thermal, and Kinetic hardeners for the first pocket. Warped back. Swapped the kinetic hardener for an EM plating. Worked well. Except for maybe against the jakars whom I probably should have kept the kinetic hardener.
