Damage dealt: All types<br />
Extras: <br />
Web/scramble: <br />
Recommended damage dealing: EM/therm<br />
Recommended ships: Paladin, Golem, CNR, Raven, Domi<br />
<br />
There are 6 mines at warp-in 22km - 70km away.<br />
After one mine explodes 4 new mines spawn. After shooting 4 more mines there's another spawn of 4 mines + the "Amarrian drone mine 1".<br />
After blowing up "Amarrian drone mine 1" the mission is over.<br />
<br />
Upon firing on the Mines, 4 Amarr Smart Drones (really Rogue Drone Cruisers and Battlecruisers) will appear around the mine, and your ship (and any in your fleet on the grid) will take 600-1000 damage. Destroy the drones after each mine to avoid being swamped.<br />
<br />
<h5>Blitz</h5>

<ul><li> For snipers: snipe all of the mines from as far away as you can. Keep shooting the mines until the "Amarrian drone mine 1" spawns. Blow that one up, and mission is completed. (Note: When I did the mission Drones didn't attack until blowing up the last 3 mines - <a class="missingpage" href="./NikalVaszol.html/edit" title="Create this page">NikalVaszol</a>.) Using this blitz you can do the mission in less than 10 minutes, easily.
</li><li> For ships with high alpha strike: if  you can kill a mine in one volley (by grouping your turrets/launchers), it will not spawn any NPCs. Mines have 1200 hp each. Using this method you can complete the mission in two minutes in absolute safety.</li></ul>

<h3>Pocket 1</h3>

You warp in the first pocket using an accelleration gate, no aggro on warp in. There are 3 groups, with increasingly larger size ships, all faction (so no bounty). The 2 groups closest to you (40km and 80km) can be pulled or sniped. If you need to get closer to the 3rd group to pull them (120km) they will aggro you when you are 80 to 90km away. The gate at about 45 km distance is locked, so you need to remove all ships anyway. The optimal range of the battleships is around 40 km usually.<br />
<br />
Spawns (might be slightly random):<br />
<h4>Group 1  (40km)</h4>

4x Divine Imperial Felix <strong>(Web/Scramble)</strong><br />
2x Imperial Tanakh<br />
2x Divine Imperial Nabih <strong>(Web/Scramble)</strong><br />
2x Imperial Avenger<br />
1x Imperial Justicar<br />
1x Imperial Dominator (BS)<br />
<br />
<h4>Group 2 (80km)</h4>

3x Imperial Origen (BS)<br />
2x Divine Imperial Nabih<br />
1x Divine Imperial Felix<br />
1x Divine Imperial Champion<br />
1x Imperial Templar Dominator<br />
<br />
<h4>Group 3 (120km)</h4>

3x Imperial Tanakh (BS)<br />
1x Imperial Templar Seer<br />
1x Imperial Origen (BS)<br />
1x Imperial Dominator (BS)<br />
1x Imperial Bataivah (BS) <br />
<br />
<span class="underline">Tags (Room 1) :</span><br />
Imperial Navy Colonel I x 11<br />
Imperial Navy General I x 12<br />
Imperial Navy General II x 1<br />
Imperial Navy Major I x 3<br />
Imperial Navy Sergeant II x 9<br />
<br />
<h3>Pocket 2</h3>

First group will aggro on warp in (or a few seconds later), 2nd group seems to aggro after group 1 goes.<br />
<br />
<h4>Group 1 (25km)</h4>

5x Frigates (Divine Imperial Felix) <strong>(Web/Scramble)</strong><br />
<br />
<h4>Group 2 (60km)</h4>

3x Cruisers (Imperial Equalizer)<br />
6x Battleships (Imperial Bataivah/Imperial Dominator/Imperial Origen)<br />
<br />
<h4>Group 3 (70km)</h4>

4x Frigates (Imperial Caius/Imperial Crusader/Divine Imperial Napat) <strong>Tracking Disruption</strong><br />
2x Cruisers (Divine Imperial Justicar)<br />
4x Battleships (Imperial Ultara)<br />
<br />
You could pull them together with the other groups if you feel confident, otherwise don't get too close and they will not target you or your drones.<br />
<br />
<span class="underline">Tags (Room 1 + Room 2) :</span><br />

<span id="comment_16"></span>From Aaron Hallstov:<br />
<br />
Also possibly worthy of note is that I completed part 4 in a passively-tanked drake (4x LSE II, passive T2 EM and T2 Therm amps) and it almost cost me my ship - it was quite hard in that I could not tank the damage, nor kill the little &quot;defender&quot; drones fast enough. Nor, for that matter, can the pilot drop a bookmark and warp back in at a different range.<br />
<br />
Also in L4, those defender drones can do roughly 600 unresisted damage per shot, and being so damaging, which might also merit an additional note in the mission brief.

Three Imperial Tamir spawned in about an estimated 10-20 minutes after the last Recon Ship fell. Didn't check to see if that was noted already, but this was the first I saw it ever do that.

<span id="comment_480"></span>Part 1 is simplified if you just target the battlecruiser lounging around the floating colony and mission done. <br />
<br />
Part 2 sit where you warp in at, depends if you have rails or artillery just shoot a single shot at each bomb and the drones do not aggro.  On the last bomb after I hit it I ended up having to blow it up for the last bomb to spawn.  Target it and blow it up and with only four total drones chasing you just warp out mission done. <br />
<br />
Part 3 - YAWN<br />
<br />
Part 4 - Straight up EM on these guys, the cruisers regen armor well so they die slow and there is a lone bs which dies fast.  Just kill all the ships and towards the end 3 more spawn.  Mission is done after that.

<span id="comment_813"></span>Part 1: If you plan on killing everything then be prepared to tank some major DPS. I figured it would be easy to clear the grid, but everything is using autocannons so they can tear you up pretty quickly.<br />
<br />
In part 1 stuff also likes to agro your drones and other ships in your fleet, so be prepared for that.

<div class="comment">
<span id="comment_847"></span>At least one of the ships in part 1/5 is using a NOS or a Neut. My perma-tank suddenly became a non-permatank on this mission. So be very careful with your active tank. I didn't see the NOS or Neut in the overview column but I'm not sure if it is supposed to show up there or not.<br />
<br />
I have only gotten this mission set once so far, so I haven't been able to figure out which ship did it.

<span id="comment_938"></span>part 1/5 has a way to make the DPS being seperated :)<br />
<br />
First, do try to agro + activate every spawns (except the prophet kill spawn)<br />
warp out, and warp back in, then only the Additional spawns will agro on you... but DON't launch the drones... just use your heavies/cruises/ guns to shoot them... and they will not agro the other 10X bC's + prophet...<br />
<br />
after killing the elite frigs, others would be quite ... straight foward :)

<span id="comment_1307"></span>4/5 is a nice way to test your tank. a dominix with Dual LAR II, 2 aux nano pumps, x2 thermic x2 em hardeners can tank the mission perfectly, you shouldn't have problems on dominix except for your drones, sometimes the recon ships can target them, but if you kill al sentries and scoop drones on each wave you wont have problems, sometimes i didn't even need to because the recon ships are mostly to target your ship. waves of recon were 5 or 6 for me, i don't clearly remember

Drones and recon frigs orbit well within range of a large smartbomb, cruisers at some 32 km. Only web/scram I faced came from the recon frigs. Smartbomb the dung out of the drones and frigs first, after that it's a walk in the park.

<span id="comment_2358"></span>In 4/5 you can warp in and out after bookmarking the entry spot. There will be 4 to 5 spawns of 1 cruicer with 2 frigates each. Concentrate your fire on the BS 1st. if frigates come close use the 2 large EM smartbombs (make shure you use the smartbombs away from your squad members or anything that can alert Concord. Once the frigates are destroyed turn of your smart bombs off. then use your drones and snip out cruicers with your guns and drones. If the agent sends you to low sector be aware of any pirates in area. Keep clear and align your ship to the gate if in low sector. The frigates are the only ones that will get with in 3km. The cruicers will orbit you 10km plus.

<span id="comment_3453"></span>Just did 2/5. Destroyed all mines in one shot each, still got shockwave and 4 drones per mine.<br />
<br />
If you destroy all mines and drones, then scavenge, you'll get somewhere close to 1800 m3 of drone-compounds.

<br />
Part 2 dropped ~1,800 m3 of drone alloys, worth approximately 2.3 mil ISK if sold to highest buy orders in Dodixie as of this writing. Of course, I'll refine it myself and sell it for a bit more. =)

<span id="comment_4185"></span>Parts 1, 2 and 4 can all be completed in an untanked sniper fit BS.  I used Navy Mega with Target painter, 3 x tracking enhancers, 3 x magstab could easily go 4 &amp; 4 but I left the repper and a DC on just in case.  Neither needed so far.  AB is highly reccomended unless you want to spend a lot of time slowboating.<br />
<br />
Part 1: Burn slowly away to the left (with rats at your back) without AB and kill the rats as they approach.   Concentrate on one group at a time.  Drones may be needs for 1st frig spawn if you start shooting too early.<br />
Part 2: group guns, instapop mines.  No damage, no spawns.<br />
Part 4: Burn away.  Give yourself 70 odd km on the towers/sentries before opening fire.  Concentrate on killing frigs/defenders as they appear.  Most will instapop if you get them at your gun's sweetspot.  Shoot whatever's closest while u wait, but switch straight back to the frigs as soon as they appear.<br />
<br />
1 &amp; 4 Once everything is out past your gun's sweet spot, come to a standstill and let them come to you.

Total from part 5 : Duration = 1h 10 min : Loot : around 4mil in junk and a good ammount of salvage ( about 13mil worth ) + 6k lp  , worth it?

<span id="comment_5234"></span>For a change of pace, did part 2 in a Tengu, got the drone spawns this time. Previous runs were in a Paladin, I'm not sure if being in a cruiser-sized ship had anything to do with it, figure it's worth noting.

<span id="comment_5522"></span>During parts 2 and 4, the spawns had nothing to do with which ships/mines were killed, but instead each spawn arrived after about a minute and a half. This can result in some serious DPS, and anyone running these should be cautious.<br />

I haven't yet run part 5.

<span id="comment_5523"></span>In addition--it should also be noted that in part 4, the Output Defenders DO NOT use Amarrian lasers, but instead use Rogue Drone weapons. Because of this, and since I was armor tanked to EM and Thermal, they put out more DPS than all the cruisers combined.

<span id="comment_5944"></span>A note on standings hits:<br />
<br />
On part 1, I destroyed several targets, including the Amarrian Battlecruiser, and lost no standing with Amarr. But when I turned the mission in, I lost 0.15 standing.<br />
<br />
On part 2, I lost 0.14 standing at some point between destroying the mines and some of the drones, but lost none for turning the mission in.<br />
<br />
On part 3, I lost 0.14 standing for turning the mission in. I declined mission 4 and was given the alternate mission 5, which did not incur any more standing loss.<br />
<br />
All in all, a lot of standing loss with Amarr, I would avoid this arc if I wanted to preserve such standings.<br />
<br />
--<br />
Also noteworthy: I completed part 2 in a Raven, with cruise launchers. The drones would spawn as soon as the missiles were fired, not giving them a chance to destroy the mine in 1 hit. I was still able to destroy each mine in a single volley without using a target painter, and I didn't have to destroy the drones because they leashed back and stopped attacking when I got more than about 50km away from them. Also, using a target painter on a mine will spawn the drones from it.

I mostly shield tank so have just about the hardest passive shield tank without modules that a Domi can have, but even generating all the spawns for salvaging, the damage taken never got close to cracking my shield.<br />
<br />
My drone skills aren't good enough for t2 sentries yet, but Garde-Is ripped through it.

<span id="comment_7109"></span>Looks like the spawns to part 2 occur when you attack the mines regardless of the taking them out in one shot. I was able to tank all of the spawns and take out all of the mines still in under 2 minutes but something you should watch out for.

<span id="comment_7819"></span>Addendum; since the advent of new, smarter NPCs that switch targets this mission is even easier if you fly with an alt. The NPCs kept switching back and forth between me and my alt while we focus fired on them one by one destroying the battleships in three volleys, cruisers in one volley, frigs melted by drones. I'm in a 1400mm arty Maelstrom, my alt is in a cruise missile Rattlesnake. They will attempt to take out drones but I ignore the frigs until they are about 10km away and then when they switch aggro to the drones I insta dock them and rotate back and forth between my drones and my alts drones. They have no effective response to this tactic and I don't lose drones. Simple mission, excellent loot in tags.
