<h3>Business Associates - Hit Man (1 of 4)</h3>

<br />
<strong>Mission Briefing:</strong> "Hm. Alright. you see, Algintal was such a nice place a few years back. The traffic through its systems and the many tourists meant we could aperate with minimal risk. But now that has all changed with the arrival of the Wiyrkomi corporation and their lackeyes, Roden Shipyards. What were once standard border-running operations now require much more time and effort to pull off.<br />
<br />
What is worse, the Caldari think they own the place just becuase they exploited a loophole in the trade agreement between the State and the Federation. They're trying to muscle us out. I want to nip that bullship in the bud and strike back at the Wiyrkomi. That's where you come in.<br />
The Wiyrkomi have installed a surveillance outpost here is Augnais. The problem is, I only found out about it a few days ago, after I'd just completed an important deal with a Republic contract of mine. If the Wiyrkomi listened in on the deal, they could comprimise the Thukkers' position here in Algintal. I thought it was too late to do anything about it, but the security measures of the Wiyrkomi are working against them here. The surveillence outpost operates in total radio silence and olny sends out its recordings in a shuttle once a week to the Wiyrkomi headquarters over in Fluekele. The shuttle will depart tomorrow, so there is still time to take care of the ... problem. I want you to head over to the surveillence outpost and take out that shuttle. Make sure you locate the surveillence recordings and confiscate them. Bring them back to me, and we're back on track."<br />

<h3>Business Associates - Bag Man (2 of 4)</h3>

<br />
<strong>Mission Briefing:</strong> "It seems every time the Thukkers get themselves in trouble they come running to me to clean things up. I mean, I can't complain - the Thukkers don't admit many foreigners into their ranks, so I'm in a privileged position, but stil...<br />
<br />
Anyway, as you might know, this constellation is full of activists fighting the Wiyrkomi and their plans to "spoil the natural beauty" to harvest resources. We've gotten into contact with some of the more belligerent activists, making them think we're here to support them, but of course we're just using them for our own benefit. We;ve provided them with some old ships and have even been providing full maintenance service for them. What they don't know is that we've used the opportunity when we service the ships to stuff their hidden cargo hatches full of contraband for them to ferry around for us. Heh, Pretty neat, eh? Yeah, well, it would be if these idiot FON guys would just shuttle peacefully around.<br />
Thing is, one of them had to get into a fight with some Serpentis pirate over in Deltole and get blown to piece. Of course the ship was full of drugs, and we need to clear that stuff up before anyone notices. Can you head over to the <a class="" href="./ContestedGallenteSkeletonCometCOSMOS.html">Contested Gallente Skeleton Comet</a> over in Deltole, locate the wrected ship, and get the drugs out? I suspect they must be spoiled by now, what with the explosion and all, but we need to get them out anyway before the activistes - or worse, the authorities - find them."<br />

<h3>Business Associates - Dirty Laundry (3 of 4)</h3>

<br />
<strong>Mission Briefing:</strong> "Yes, in fact. I'm feeling very confident in your abilities, so I'm setting up a big job for you. But before that, I need you to take care of a smaller matter for me. I have aquired certain items that cast Veko Tallaja, the operation supervisor for Wiyrkomi here in Algintal, in a rather negative light. I'm not going to use this stuff just now, but I need to store it somewhere safe. I want you to head over to Fluekele and drop it off at the Pend Insurance station there. A friend of mine will then place it in a safe-deposit box there. I know it's a trivial thing i'm asking, but this is sensitive material that absolutely can't get into the wrong hands ... and, besides, I need more time to prepare for your big mission."<br />

<h3>Business Associates - Kill the Competition (4 of 4)</h3>

<br />
<strong>Mission Briefing:</strong> "Algintal has always been a favored spot for smugglers. It's far enough out of the way so as not to attract too much attention from the authorities. Besides us at Trust Partners, the Serpentis are out here in force, as well as several independents. Usually we try to stay well clear of each other, but sometimes a group arrives that thinkis it can muscle everyone else out. One such group has been making a nuisance of itself recently, and it's time to take them out. We've played Mr. Nice Guy until now, but no longer.<br />
<br />
The smugglers in question have built themselves a nice little hideout near here. We're not plaing any gamges here, so killing them is the only item on the agenda. It was hell to track them down, so make sure you take them all out in one go so I don't have to repeat the process later.<br />
If you pull this off with style, I'm sure some associates of mine would love for you to work a bit for them. When you bring me those dead smugglers' DNA, I'll give you some ship logs that my associates need to tamper with a bit to make them seem as innocent as a virgin's butt. Those logs should be ample proof to them that you're a trusted friend."<br />
