<br />
Note: Proximity aggro is a major factor in this mission. Please be aware that you can aggro a neutral group by just moving into its aggro bubble.<br />
<div class="indent">Drones can be deployed as per normal as long as the conditions are met. See <span class="underline">Aggro Notes</span>.</div>
<br />
<h3>Single Pocket</h3>

<br />
At warp-in, you will see Group 4. Four other groups will spawn several seconds later. <br />
The spawn order is Group 2, Group 1, Group 3 and finally Group 5. <br />
<br />
 It is recommended that you DO NOT MOVE your ship. <br />
<span class="underline">The proximity aggro bubble for Group 4 is about 80km and you may get aggroed EITHER during warp-in or if you move towards it.</span><br />
<br />
Group 1 & 5 will auto-aggro immediately.<br />
Group 2, 3 & 4 will remain neutral until attacked or aggroed via proximity.<br />
<br />
<span class="underline"><strong>Warning</strong></span><br />
<ul><li> The two Arch elite frigates in Group 1 will frequently warp scramble you in under 20 secs.</li></ul>
<br />
<span class="underline">Aggro Notes:</span><br />
<ul><li> Attacking Group 1 does not aggro any other groups. You can safely deploy drones to attack this group.
</li><li> Attacking Group 2 aggros Group 3 (and vice-versa). You can safely deploy drones after the pair have been aggroed.
</li><li> Attacking Group 4 aggros Group 5 (and vice-versa). You can safely deploy drones after the pair have been aggroed.</li></ul>

<br />
<h4>Group 1 (Auto-aggro): Ripped Superstructure (25-35km)</h4>

2x Elite Frigates (Arch Gistii Rogue/Hijacker) <strong>Web/Scramble</strong><br />
2x Battlecruisers (Gistatis Tribuni)<br />
3x Battleships (Gist Warlord/Saint/Nephilim)<br />
<br />
<h4>Group 2: Spaceshuttle Wreck (45-60km)</h4>

3x Destroyers (Gistior Haunter/Defiler)<br />
4x Battleships (Gist Commander/General)<br />
<br />
<h4>Group 3: Amarr Trade Station Ruins (60-70km)</h4>

2x Elite Frigates (Arch Gistii Hijacker) <strong>Web/Scramble</strong><br />
2x Elite Cruisers (Arch Gistum Liquidator/Marauder)<br />
<br />
<h4>Group 4: Amarr Military Station Ruins (65-90km)</h4>

2x Battlecruisers (Gistatis Praefectus/Tribunus) <br />
4x Battleships (Gist Commander/General/War General/Warlord)<br />
<br />
<h4>Group 5 (Auto-aggro): Amarr Commercial Station Ruins (80-105km)</h4>

6x Battleships (Gist Commander/General/War General)<br />
<br />
<h5>Tip</h5>

<ul><li> Throw off aggro from Group 5 : Wait until an enemy ship from Group 5 have locked your ship. Warp out, then warp back in.
</li><li> Be absolutely careful not to move towards the neutral groups. Move away from them to minimize setting off the proximity aggro. This is best done by moving up or down in the z axis as most of them spawn in a x-y plane.
</li><li> Recommended order of elimination : Group 1, Group 5 (if you do not warp out to throw-off aggro) & Group 4, finally Group 2 &  Group 3.
</li><li> Mission is flagged completed when ALL ships in Group 5 are killed.
</li><li> Except Gist Saint and the Battlecruiser the Battleships are all coming in range of 5-8 km. Great for salvaging afterwards.</li></ul>
<br />
<h5>Blitz</h5>

<ul><li> Warp in, kill (or ignore) Group 1. 
</li><li> Eliminate all ships from Group 5 and warp out.</li></ul>
<br />
<h5>ISK</h5>

<ul><li> Bounty: 9,100,000.00 (15.11.2013)
</li><li> Salvage/loot: 4,750,000.00 (15.11.2013)</li></ul>

<span id="comment_41"></span>Possibly the most difficult mission I have ever completed.  Dual repper Domi, had to warp out approximately 4 times.  With the random aggro, had all of the Machs circling me.  Had to warp in, kill 1 Mach, warp out, dock, repeat until I could handle the DPS.

Started as per EVE Survival to avoid massive aggro, after the first group I hit the Generals/Commanders - no aggro from remaining group at 80K and after taking out the 2nd group got Objective achieved.

<span id="comment_354"></span>This mission is not as hard as JennvanaaSallen says. I did it fine with a single repper Typhoon, which is nowhere near as good as a Dominix or Raven at mission running. I did not have to warp out. Take out the initial aggro, then aggro the rest of the groups when ready. All I did was move away from the other spawns while fighting in case the drones got aggro.

<span id="comment_650"></span>My first warp-in positioned me so that I had full aggro from all groups within the first 30 seconds without ever having moved. I warped out and tried again. This time I got aggroed only by group 1. My drones also did not get aggroed by anything else. Full aggro would support JennvanaaSallen's view, however. 17 battleships in total is quite a handfull.

<span id="comment_862"></span>Followed the aggro guide as stated, group 4 didn't even aggro me when I attacked group 5. DPS was very low in a Raven with 1x Invul, 1x Kin, 1x exp<br />
<br />
One thing to note is to make sure you let all the groups spawn and the ones that auto-aggro you start shooting you before you start shooting things

<span id="comment_980"></span>For gallente ship pilots.<br />
On a mega, tanking: 1 LARt2,  2x Exp, 1xKin, 1DCU its more than enough can tank 2 groups without warping out w/ overall resists of ~80%.<br />
<br />
On a side note, its a blaster friendly mission, most pirates will get within 15km range. Save the HACs.

Bring Eplosive-Drones (Berserker/Valkyrie/Warrior/Bouncer) for best damage<br />
<br />
I only got partial aggro from group 5 on warp-in (from three BS) for some reason, but they're pretty far out anyway. Takes ages for them to get in shooting range.

<span id="comment_2537"></span>Completed Pulse Navy Apoc, single Amarr LAR+rig, no warpouts: 1xKin, 1xTherm, 2x explosive; AB, tracking computer. Two faction heatsinks made me wish for three. Highly recommend the AB. Drone aggro can be surprising, keep an eye on them. Be aware that the battleships can do a lot of damage if they get in close--and on an Amarr ship, you'll have to use close-range ammo for good dps from EM/Therm.

<span id="comment_2682"></span>I did this in a Buffer Tanked Raven. I would Suggest torps (If you want to wait long enough) As the BS's DO come into range. I haven't tested if it would be quicker or not though :) But it might help get the closer BS's off you when you accidently pull off alot of aggro.

<span id="comment_5667"></span>Regarding Gallente and Amarr: For angels you should use webs (instead of Tracking Computers), preferably faction webs so you can start reducing speed at 13+ km already. Lasers and rails work almost as well as fusion-loaded projectiles then.

Kill the scramming frigates quickly and you're safe from then on.

Fly away from the groups to avoid accidental aggro.

<span id="comment_7652"></span>Start by flying straight up. You won't need a tank or tracking computer. If you keep at a distance (90km for an extreme, but significantly closer as well), whether aggroed or not the battleships from 4 and 5, other than one or two at a time, won't even leave their starting location to follow you. You can lead them off and mash them until you're comfortable closing. The frigates and cruisers are easily taken care of at a distance. You won't even need to boost your shields. An AB is your friend. A Nightmare with three faction heatsinks did fine with Aurora/Microwave especially for frigates, though I usually closed soon to Multifrequency for most Battleships. Was not painfully slow even with EM/Therm damage.

<span id="comment_7804"></span>Contrary to the comments this mission is pretty easy. Fly in, kite away from the first group, take out the web/scram ships and defeat in detail at your leisure in anything that's got a decent Exp/Kin tank. Completed and salvaged in under 30 minutes with a Mach and good skills.

<span id="comment_7908"></span>Ran with Vexor Navy Issue; very easy mission. Take some distance, deploy sentries, focus on the aggroing groups only, knock out potential scramblers immediately. Then defeat the rest at will.
