<br />
<br />
<h3>Pocket 1</h3>

<br />
Aggro from Group 1 on warp-in.<br />
<ul><li> Solo - Group 2 may aggro when you attack Group 1.
</li><li> Fleet - Group 2 <strong>WILL</strong> aggro Fleet member attacking Group 1.</li></ul>
<br />
<h4>Group 1 (15-30km)</h4>

3x Cruisers (3x Mordus Leopard / 2x Mordus Lion)<br />
3x Battleships (2x Mordus Phanti / 1x Mordus Gigamar)<br />
<br />
<h4>Group 2 (Left rear - 65-90km)</h4>

6x Frigates (4x Mordus Gladius / 2x Mordus Bounty Hunter)<br />
5x Cruisers (3x Mordus Puma / 2x Mordus Lion)<br />
<br />
<h4>Group 3 (Right rear - 76-90km)</h4>

6x Frigates (4x Mordus Katana / 2x Mordus Gladius)<br />
4x Cruisers (Mordus Bobcat)<br />
2x Battleships (Mordus Sequestor)<br />
<br />
<h5>Mineable Asteroids:</h5>

Lots of Plagioclase, Pyroxeres, and Veldspar in a nice belt about 40km long.<br />
<br />
<h3>Pocket 2</h3>

<br />
4 Groups - Groups will not aggro until fired upon.<br />
<br />
<h4>Group 1 (front - 35km)</h4>

8x Frigates (5x Mordus Sabre / 3x Mordus Katana)<br />
2x Interceptors (Mordus Bounty Hunter) <strong>(Web/Scramble)</strong><br />
<br />
<h4>Group 2 (back left - 60-70km)</h4>

5x Frigates (Mordus Gladius)<br />
12x Cruisers (3x Mordus Cheetah / 5x Mordus Bobcat / 2x Mordus Lion / 2x Mordus Puma)<br />
5x Battleships (1x Mordus Sequestor / 3x Mordus Phanti / 1x Mordus Gigamar)<br />
<br />
<h4>Group 3 (back right - 80-100km)</h4>

4x Frigates (Mordus Katana)<br />
5x Cruisers (3x Mordus Leopard / 2x Mordus Lion)<br />
3x Battleships (2x Mordus Sequestor / 1x Mordus Mammoth) <br />
<strong>(Killing group 3 completes Mission)</strong><br />
<br />
<h4>Group 4 (back center - 106-121km)</h4>

7x Frigates (5x Mordus Katana / 2x Mordus Bounty Hunter)<br />
8x Cruiser (5x Mordus Cheetah / 3x Mordus Katana)<br />
<br />
<h5>Note</h5>
 
<ul><li> Group 4 will maintain lock once Target Painted or fired upon, but you must be within 40km of spawn location or group will return to spawn location.
</li><li> Group 4 can change lock after returning to Spawn Location.</li></ul>
<br />
<h5>Tip</h5>

Using Sentry drones within about 80km of a group causes the whole room to aggro. However, in each stage it's possible to position yourself distance-wise so that you can happily take out at least the first group without aggro'ing the others (except as noted).<br />
<br />
For the people using abbadon apocalypse, and paladins w/megapulse lasers. there is a very safe way of doing this mission, room 1 and 2: <br />
<ul><li> Get into weapons range of the bounty hunters around 55km with radio. Attack and kill both of them. This will aggro the entire room, once the attack starts then turn left and fly parallel with the incoming group. 
</li><li> Target priority should be Frigates, cruisers and then battleships once they reach 20-25km. Light drones will make short work of the frigates </li></ul>
<br />
<h5>Blitz</h5>

<ul><li> Pocket 1: Kill all ships.
</li><li> Pocket 2: Kill group 3 (the group with the Mordus Mammoth.) attacking a ship of group 3 will get you stage aggro. To avoid that, fly towards the right edge of the group and wait until the ships of group 3 start attacking your ship. Afterwards you can take down the ships without aggroing the rest in room 2.</li></ul>
<br />
<h5>Loot</h5>

Approx 3,400 to 4,000 plus m3- Cap Boosters (all types), assorted ammo (Hybrid/Missile), T1/Named Modules<br />
<br />
<h5>Bounty</h5>

Approx 10.6 Mil ISK for all ships<br />

<span id="comment_302"></span>This is quite some hardware shop. <br />
<br />
It seems difficult to really manage the aggro in the first room and something has obviously been changed there. In the first group I counted: 4 Gladius, 2 Bounty Hunters, 3 Puma, 2 Lion. - But -! If you shot one them, you aggro the complete room. Full to the brim with angry mordus. Thankfully they are slow. Two friends: Distance and Run Like Hell. <br />
<br />
The second room behaves. Aggro does not propagate between groups.

<span id="comment_423"></span>It might be best to avoid sentries in both of these pockets.  I was getting sentry aggro repeatedly, from multiple distances, in the first room.  Once I got beyond a 100km in the second room, it started to behave.  What was worse is that they wouldn't aggro me, just the drones, and then would fly back to their starting positions.<br />
<br />
The AI in these rooms is messed up, so be careful.

<span id="comment_492"></span>Second room does approx. 1760 DPS (including the frigs that can be killed seperately), 2/3 of the Damage is Kin, rest Therm.<br />
Since there doesn't seem to be a way to aggro only a part of the room, you're gonna have to either tank or outrun it all...

<span id="comment_552"></span>Ran this through with a raven. The shoot from a distance and run like bloody heck method works well. fit a sensor booster and hit them from about 115-130km out. you can kill all the frigs before they get into range, and what passes your missiles have drones clean up.  Then kill off the cruisers because they melt fast to drop dps.  Toggling between boosting and just hardeners you can balance cap very well and not have to warp out much.

Just let them come, no warp out necessary. First the frigs using drones, then cruisers, than battleships. Didn't even move in 2nd pocket.

<br />
but to take note on the highest bounty ship... the mordus mammoth... as it's the last ship.. i went afk with my boosting off, fired a total of 126 volley's of cruise missles (malkluth cruises X6), and the only thing i managed to take down is it's shield and 70% of it's armor... having level 3's on sub skills, and level 3 on cruise missles..., this ship is one of the hardest BS's i never seen :), even thou i know there's more other shippies that has a harder armor :D

<br />
One group auto-aggros now, and you warp in nearly on top of the gate. The other group doesn't aggro unless you attack them. The fear of Room 1 DPS is no longer evident. Please note I did this post-QR test with a Paladin using all faction gear, thusly your results may vary.

<span id="comment_1151"></span>This mission is a lot easier in QR with the aggro changes.  I used both of my accounts and on the initial warp in my alt drew room aggro when he fired upon group 1.  Once he warped out they returned to their group and stopped firing.<br />
<br />
Completed with 2 Hyperions but only tanked with one.<br />
2 kin T2 hardeners<br />
2 therm T2 hardeners<br />
1 LAR<br />
<br />
Payout break down was 15m for bounties and 18+ for loot and salvage.  Not a hard mission and worth the time if you have it.  The Mammoth is a PITA and had to break my alt off of looting to take him down.  I had 5x T2 Hammerheads and 7x 425's and still wasn't able to break his shield tank.

<span id="comment_1388"></span>done in dominix with dual LAR, x2 aux nano pumps and 4 hardeners (2 kinetic and 2 thermal). first pocket is easy to tank with that setup, armor was never compromised. killed the frigs fast with Wardens I and the rest with ogres II. second pocket is a bit harder to tank and you better kill things fast or put yourself at good distance to pop out shit with sentrys. with this setup i got enough time to kill the frigs/cruiser before the dps killed my armor, just allign and kill the webbers and you should be ok<br />
<br />
DR: easy to medium (if you can't tank it all)

Now, this takes a lot of skill to fly, because you have to more around, keep speed up to get hit less by guns and rails. So kill webbers off quickly, leave frigs to drones, and go to next closest target thats above frig size. Once in range, melt target, and go to the next.<br />
<br />
Now, so far I've been able to complete nearly every, nos = bad, level 4 mission in this ship, and it's more interesting than the standard raven action.

Spawns come one by one, biggest problem: if your drones come too close to the next group they open fire. Watch your drones HP! (Aggroreset once drones are back in dronebay)<br />

It is nice to see someone else using a Sleipnir for mission running. I've just completed this mission, having had to warp out twice. It's hard not to agro other groups. My drones got agro too. It's one of those times when I wished I had taken the Maelstrom out. Range would be good on this one.

<span id="comment_3920"></span>About the projectile choice: Most battleships have a really high Therm resistance. (70-80%) Exp is second highest. But armor has an exp hole. EMP, Fusion and Titanium Sabot has approx the same ammount of damage after resistances.<br />
 <br />
Versius shields on the Mammoth the ammunition is ranked (best to worst):<br />
<br />
Quake (20,8), Hail (19,2) , EMP (18,8), Barrage (17,2), Fusion (16), Titanium Sabot (14,4), Tremor (13,6), Phased Plasma (12), Depleted Uranium, Carbonized Lead, Proton L, Nuclear L<br />
<br />
Versius the armor, Hail, Quake, Fusion, and Barrage is the best choice. EMP deals close to half the damage of Hail, Quake and Fusion. Phased plasma a bit better, but not much. But it doesn't repair armor, so this is not as important as penetrating the shield.<br />
<br />
Cruisers have a high therm resistance, but not as severe as the battleships. So phased plasma may be used against them. Frigs have even resists.

<span id="comment_3921"></span>Vs Shields on the Lion EMP is the best. EMP L deals close to 30 damage. The T2 close range ammo 20-25 (quake, barrage, hail), Fusion 19, Titanium Sabot 17 and Phased plasma 22.<br />
<br />
This means T2 and EMP is one of the first ammo types you should consider for close range battles, since it's the battleships that will receive the most damage. If t2 is not an option, Fusion is also worth a try as it removes armor pretty fast.

<br />
Even with full room aggro in second pocket orbiting a wreck, no need to turn the second booster on. Passive recharge is enough in first pocket.

<span id="comment_4170"></span>Did this in a Nighthawk with T2 HMLs, very easy to tank. 1x Kin, 1x Thermic, 1x Invuln (due to the low midslot amount) and you should have 90+ resists.<br />
<br />
Also did it faster than a Paladin Marauder, for comparison. Same character, more gunnery than missile launcher SP.

<span id="comment_5367"></span>second room is an absolute PITA for drones. I lost 2 ogre II's, 3 beserker II's, and a hobgoblin II in one sitting. groups will repeatedly deagress you and aggro your drones, which get chewed up before they can make it back. shooting the deagrees groups works sometimes, but by the time they re aggro you (if that), your drones are already in structure...

<span id="comment_6164"></span>How to blitz without stage-aggro in room 2:<br />
Step A - warp through first gate<br />
Step B - Wipe out everything in room1<br />
Step C - Approach the ship in group 3 positioned most to the right until group 3 aggroes. After that, killing group 3 does NOT activate any of the other groups. Beware: flying in a straight line towards that ship still might get you into the aggro distance of other groups depending on your warp-in, so better double-click near it to head into that direction. aggro distance is about 35km, if I guess correctly

Pocket 2: No agro on warp in but you will have a cluster of frigates in your face at 15Km. Don't touch, move away and to the left along the  outside of station. Don't shoot anything until you start to get agro. (about 70Km ). Heavy Caldari Scourge missiles will take care of the Mammoth in a couple of min. Mission's over when group 3 finished but you can pick off the rest for the bounties.<br />
