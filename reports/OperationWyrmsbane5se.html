<br />
<img src="./screenshots/operationwyrmsbane5se-all.jpg" alt="Initial Group, Spawn 1 and 2" title="Operation Wyrmsbane Base Group and First 2 Spawns)" /><br />
<br />
<h4>Spawn 3:</h4>

Triggered by Hacking Info Shard<br />
Spawns at a distance of 2,000 - 2,500 m from Shard<br />
This whole spawn must be eliminated to be able to access the can after it is hacked successfully.<br />
<br />
4x Battleships (Core Lord Admiral)<br />
6x Cruisers (Corelum Chief Sentinel)<br />
<br />
<br />
<h4>Spawn 4:</h4>

<br />
3x Battleships (Core Grand Admiral)<br />
4x Battlecruisers (Corelatis Captain)<br />
3x Cruisers (Corelum Chief Sentinel)<br />
3x Destroyers (Corelior Infantry) <br />
<br />
<br />
<h5>Structure Loot:</h5>

<ul><li> Cruise Missles from the Bunkers
</li><li> Serpentis Info Shard will drop regular radar site loot (e.g. datacore, decryptors or decryptor parts)
</li><li> Serpentis Stronghold drops nothing of interest </li></ul>
<br />
<h5>Tips:</h5>

<ul><li> It is strongly suggested that you use Logistics support to keep your tank alive.
</li><li> Remember to have a hacking module (Codebreaker) in case there is a Serpentis Info Shard (does not appear every time).</li></ul>

<span id="comment_885"></span>Ran this mission in a dominix with 3 t2 kin/therm hardeners and a t2 damage control with another dominix remote repping with 6 large 'solace' armor reps.  Total dps from the initial spawn was around 2900 with a spread of about 65% therm and 35% kin.<br />
<br />
The spawn that appears when attacking the stronghold mostly aggroed me (mission owner), but the frigs and a couple of cruisers aggroed the nearby drones.

<span id="comment_2542"></span>Its not needed to hack the Info Shard to complete this mission, although it would be a good idea to do so. Soloed the mission in a passive tanked Drake (although passive tank is not needed here), key was to eliminate the stasis towers fast enough so I could maintain a faster speed to avoid some hits.

<span id="comment_3286"></span>warping in at 0 is not a good idea, alot of dps from the cruiser missile towers and the frigs will have you scrambled fast.

<span id="comment_3347"></span>This was my second lev 5 mission, the first being Sansha on the Horizon (to which I've also added a comment).  Same deal, I don't know how to present my experiences chronologically so I'll just brainstorm them and list them as they come:<br />
<br />
-I did this in a tanked/railed mega: 3kin/2thr hardeners, logistics was a Raven with 4t2 cruise, 4 large solace RRs and a compliment of 75m3 t2 repair drones.  This was JUST enough for me to tank the mission, as in the beginning my armor would slowly decline until I had wiped out a few ships and it began to climb back up.<br />
-while this mission has no neut towers, I consider this mission to be very difficult due to the staggering amount of dps.<br />
-much like Sansha on the Horizon, you have the option to warp in at different distances, but you CANNOT warp in beyond 100km from the beacon.<br />
-target dampening is an issue, but it's actually not as bad as the likes of lev4 Blockade.<br />
-I chose to first focus on Grand Admirals to lower incoming dps, but I imagine a concentrated effort to take down the cruise batteries would be just as effective.<br />
-There was no info shard in my mission.<br />
-total bounties came in around 18 mil, salvage was laughable (this result was on par with Sansha on the Horizon...strange).<br />
-There is no shame in rewarping to re-establish aggro on the intended tank.<br />
<br />
Good luck to those of you out there who want to attempt it.  Just be sure you can rep like a mofo.  ;o

<span id="comment_3714"></span>I checked that with warping in again - for me the Info Shard was never there before, but warping in more than once helped, can confirm that. Reducing DPS is indeed best done with killing the batteries - they are easy to kill and deal much damage. Second should be battlecruisers. However, esp. with a gunboat killing frigs before they enter orbit is also a good idea.

<span id="comment_4231"></span>Doing it atm with a navy scorp and a domi with t2 sentries/drones and 3 large shield transporters. <br />
<br />
Spawns for me were different. Killing the battlecruisers triggered both the first and second spawn and the amounts were different as well. Though with this setup it's easily tankable, even with rewarps included. I didn't even need to kill the towers.

<span id="comment_4340"></span>I solo'ed this in a passive tanked rattlesnake. I was able to do this mission without my shield dropping below 75%.  Also, I used a true sansha smartbomb since there was no neut towers to eliminate most of the initial group.  I completed this mission (not counting salvaging) in less then 30 minutes.  By far the easiest mission i've done yet.   Also... the info shard never spawned for me.

<br />
I SUSPECT the current blitz is to warp tank in + RR after, then focus all firepower on the Stronghold.

<span id="comment_6361"></span>Blitz is possible, just take out Stronghold.  In a passive Tengu I knocked out stasis towers and webbing frigs just in case - tank never dropped below 70%.  2 Corr C Kinetic and 1 Corr C Heat.  Shard was not present in magnetic structure even after destroying them.  15 to 20 Minuites.  Easy.
