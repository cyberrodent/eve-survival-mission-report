Faction: Thukker Tribe<br />
Mission type:  Encounter<br />
Space type: Normal<br />
Damage dealt: Exp, Therm<br />
Recommended damage dealing: Therm, Kin<br />
Ship: Drake<br />
Web / Jam / ECM:  None<br />
<br />
<strong><span class="underline"><span style="color: red; ">WARNING:</span></span></strong><br />
<ul><li> You will suffer 2.4% a standings loss with the Minmatar Republic for destroying Minmatar Republic's Republic Fleet Detective in Part 3. It is not necessary to destroy this ship to complete the mission, however. Standings losses are based on specific ship kills, NOT the mission as a whole.
</li><li> Reinforcement spawns will target and attack any drones sitting outside your ship when they spawn</li></ul>
<br />
Waves warp in at about 20km from the beacon and are timed not triggered, intervals between waves are generally 4-5 minutes (timed 4x different times). There is a chance of a +3 implant drop from one of the cruisers (Thukker Mercenary Captain).<br />
<br />
<h4>Wave 1:</h4>
 
20km from warp-in<br />
3x Thukker Mercenary Eliminators (Cruiser)<br />
<br />
<h4>Wave 2:</h4>

Spawn 24km from warp-in<br />
5x Thukker Mercenary Fighters (Frigate)<br />
2-3x Thukker Mercenary Eliminators (Cruiser)<br />
<br />
<h4>Wave 3:</h4>

Spawn 34km from warp-in<br />
4x Thukker Mercenary Elite Fighters (Frigate)<br />
1x Thukker Mercenary Eliminator (Cruiser)<br />
<br />
<h4>Wave 4:</h4>

Spawn 32km from warp-in<br />
2x Thukker Mercenary Elite Fighters (Frigate)<br />
2x Thukker Mercenary Eliminators (Cruiser)<br />
<br />
<h4>Wave 5:</h4>

Spawn 22km from warp-in<br />
2x Thukker Captain's Wingman (Frigate)<br />
1x Thukker Mercenary Captain (Cruiser)<br />
<br />
<h5>Blitz</h5>

Blitzing is not possible, you will require about 15 minutes for this part<br />
<br />
<h5>Hint</h5>

Do not forget to loot the Mercenary Pilot dropped from the last killed ship<br />
Last killed ship drops in loot +3 implant, dont forget to check for additional 8 mil isk (chances not known, reported by couple players)<br />
Return your drones to drone bay after each wave or they will be targeted and killed by the succeeding reinforcement wave.<br />
<br />
<br />
<h5>Mining</h5>

There are multiple veldspar and scordite asteroids , about 22km from the warp-in beacon.  <br />
<br />
<h2>Technological Secrets (2 of 3) </h2>

<br />
Mission type: Courier (0.1 m3)<br />
<br />
<h2>Technological Secrets (3 of 3)</h2>

<br />
Faction: Minmatar<br />
Mission type:  Encounter<br />
Space type: Normal<br />
Damage dealt: Exp, Therm<br />
Recommended damage dealing: Exp, Kin<br />
No bounty on any ships in this mission<br />
<br />
<h4>Wave 1:</h4>

Spawn present at warp-in, spread out 5-20k. Support frigates close quickly (700 m/s)!!<br />
<br />
1x Republic Fleet Detective (Frigate) (see note at page top on standings loss)<br />
4x Republic Fleet Soldiers (Frigate)<br />
2x Republic Fleet C-1 Support Frigate (<strong>webifier</strong>)<br />
1x Republic Fleet D-1 Support Frigate (<strong>target painter</strong>)<br />
1x Republic Fleet Rupture (Cruiser) <strong>Trigger</strong><br />
<br />
<h4>Wave 2:</h4>

3x Republic Fleet Ruptures (one of them: trigger)<br />
2x Chief Republic Kvarm (tgt painter)<br />
<br />
<h4>Wave 3:</h4>

3x Republic Destroyers (Tribal Faxi)<br />
2x Republic BCs (Venis)<br />
<br />
The last wave does considerably more damage than the first two, so if you are not ready or too busy picking up cans you can get caught with your pants down!<br />
<br />
<h5>Loot</h5>

Got about 5,300,000 isk in loot. Mostly from the tags. Other players reporting up to 14m in comments.<br />
<br />
Drops = ~5,300,000 isk<br />
Salvage = ~200,000 isk<br />
Bounties = 0 isk<br />
<br />
<strong>Total</strong> = ~5,500,00 isk<br />
<br />
<br />
<h5>Blitz</h5>

Mission completed when wave 2 is killed, no need to engage wave 3.<br />
You do <em>not</em> need to kill the Republic Fleet Detective to finish the mission.<br />

Maybe it was just a bug but, in the first room, it spawned every ship for me. Every wave in one. Needless to say it caused havoc and pandamodium on a large scale (read, my drones gone and my ship battered).

<div class="comment">
<span id="comment_4518"></span>Part 1/3: Do not bother bringing a good ship trying to blitz this mission (hint * tengu * hint) - i.e. when you are just harvesting standings. You will die of boredom waiting for next spawns to appear. As every full wave is killable in 30 to 60 seconds, you will spend next ten minutes staring at empty space, even long after you looted all wrecks (not that there will be many). Next wave, rinse, repeat, again and again. I didn't time it, but it probably took about 30-50 minutes to finish (I had plenty of time to prepare some food and register on eve-suvival while waiting for spawns, among other), while in total being max. 2-3 minutes in actual fight. Good mission for a properly fitted T1 frigate/cruiser, anything above is overkill. Even then, it's probably not worth the time.<br />
<br />
Best damage to deal: Thermal, secondary Kin/Exp.<br />
<br />
Part 3/3: As stated, is full of regular Republic Fleet ships, expect significant standing loss with Minmatar.<br />
<br />
Conclusion: If you are in hurry and/or don't specifically hate Minmatar, just skip the arc.

<span id="comment_4747"></span>Damage Types in Part 3 Definitely are Kinetic + Explosive.<br />
All heavy missiles fired in this part are scourge missiles except the final 2 BC, they fire explosive missiles. Projectile turrets are firing with explosive so theres no thermal in this Part at all.<br />
<br />
The BC are not really that tough as it is described but you dont have to fight them anyways. I found 2nd wave a lot more dangerous, maybe because i had thermal hardener fitted while they fired a hailstorm of scourge missiles :)<br />
<br />
And I have to agree with DogNose:<br />
If you use a gunship, be sure to have at least one assault launcher or rocket launcher fitted in addition to drones since those support frigs have a good shield tank and are quite fast. take them out with your turrets while still at range, saves you from a lot of trouble

Done in 15 minutes in a legion. So either the times are random, but the same for all spawns, or this mission has been updated to make the waves spawn faster since many of the comments here were posted.

My suggestions in the last wave, kill everyone else first and leave the Caption's ship last. There easier and quick to kill and this way less dps to deal with.

First wave frigates rush in for brawling, and webbed and painted. Changed drones from Berserker I's to Valkyrie II's after first wave and second and thrid wave was much easier to deal with. Last wave had 3 ships as noted above and was very easy to deal with. Deal with destroyers first and then with BS. Tacktic was to kite 55Km out. Total gear picked up was 13mil worth.
