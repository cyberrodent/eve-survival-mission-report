<span id="comment_5567"></span>And you really *can't* passively tank this mission. My log was showing no hits and I still received damage from the Rogue Drone virus well into 1/2 of my armor before I warped out. Working out an active shield tanking Tengu was not something I'd planned to do in the middle of a mission :)

<span id="comment_5583"></span>23:37:40 Combat Spearhead Alvus aims well at you, inflicting 217.5 damage.<br />
this was on a Navy apoc with 86% em and 82% therm resistance, I don't think they are doing mainly EM/Therm, I also noticed some of the cruisers useing Havoc missiles, I'm starting to think this mission is like other level 4 drone missions where Explosive damage is the primary.  The only reason I survived was because of my 2 Large Armor Reps.

<span id="comment_5807"></span>I also had to shoot the Patient Zero to start the spawns.<br />
I did this in a Navy Scorpion set up for a normal Rouge Drone mission and it work out well.<br />
The Patient Zero structure was fairly tough to take down though.<br />
AoE damage happened about every 10 seconds.

<span id="comment_5834"></span>used about 2*75 + ~15 volleys of ham @ 960 damage. means the structure has about 160k hp, but no resists (960 is my normal hull damage too used therm and em missiles to test)<br />
<br />
this mission is quite easy done in a ham legion, the bs seldom hit with 10km orbit @ 500m/s, em missiles for the drones, therm for the other ships

<span id="comment_6254"></span>Was able to to tank this in a HM Drake w/3 active hardeners, 1 amp, shield power relay, DC, 2x BCU, 1 LSE, AB, purger rigged.  Didn't realize just how rough the AoE would be on the Hob IIs and lost them immediately upon deployment.  Keep the hobbies inside for this one.  I just tanked the AoE for the entire mission until the end.  The hobs blowing up was the most exciting thing about the mission.

<div class="comment">
<span id="comment_6386"></span>The area of effect damage from &quot;Patient Zero&quot; will also damage drones, making drones useless until the building is destroyed, first. Drone boats should be refit for turret or missile damage and seek assistance from another ship to destroy &quot;Patient Zero&quot;. Once &quot;Patient Zero&quot; is destroyed, the AOE damage stops and drones may be safely deployed. It may be necessary to kite the rats while destroying &quot;Patient Zero&quot;.<br />
<br />
FACTION BALANCING: My records DO NOT show a standing loss with Gallente Federation for completing Patient Zero. In fact, the last time I did this mission, it was a +9.0% standing gain because I did it for a Gallente Storyline Agent. I posit that ForaEvE is looking at a loss for Derived Modification because he/she ran the mission for the Caldari or Amarr.<br />
<br />
Please note that &quot;Derived Modification&quot; faction standing losses are relative to who you're running the mission for and should not be mistaken for &quot;Combat - Ship Kill&quot;, which are always the same every time you run the mission.

<span id="comment_7018"></span>Very easy mission in a Golem with Gist X-type X-Large sheild boost.<br />
Took out first group then activated spawns by shooting patient Zero.<br />
Took out each group spawning after last ship killed each group.<br />
Did 4700 damage to Patient Zero used 1 full group of EM cruise to finish.<br />
Only 5.2 mil bounty but a nice 12% faction to Gallante out of the Sisters lvl4 <br />
Station.

<span id="comment_7157"></span>Finished in Tengu. Quite easy but very time consuming. unless you need standings I would definately decline this one. I fit my tengu for all tank. Should have went all gank. :( There won't be another try unless drone loot comes back or I really need the standings.

<span id="comment_7292"></span>Just completed with Maelstrom (824.3 DPS) 1400mm arty and alt in Rattlesnake (611 DPS) with EMP cruise missiles. I lost 5 heavy drones to the AOE damage on my alt. You will need to be able to hit ships at less than 5000 meters to you as the npcs will close in fairly quickly. I didn't see any warp scramming. We stopped moving 60km from &quot;patient zero&quot; which is a ruined ship that likely won't be on your overview. Both ship active shield tanked. Properly prepared this was an easy mission with garbage loot and crap bounties.

<span id="comment_7661"></span>For me, each wave have one more BS than the guide gives. e.g. guide says 4 , I got 5.  Also, it may be a specific Domination drone that is the trigger as it was the second Domination BS of three killed from the first wave that spawned the second wave.  Odyssey 1.0.7.
