<h2>(Part 1 of 3)</h2>

<br />
Faction: Amarr<br />
Mission type: Deadspace - No Gate<br />
Web/Scramble: All Frigates<br />
Extras: Energy Neutralizer Sentry IIIs, NOS<br />
Damage dealt: EM 55% / Therm 45%<br />
Recommended damage dealing: EM/Thermal <br />
Recommended ships: (1) Maelstrom w/ passive tank and (1) Maelstrom w/ Shield Transporters<br />
<br />
Direct warp into Deadspace. No gate.<br />
<br />
<h3>Warp-In</h3>

<br />
<strong>Note:</strong>  Only the Special Forces Squadron that appears at 8 minutes after warp-in needs to be destroyed to complete this mission.  However, if you approach to under 10km from the Ghost Ship, it will trigger numerous additional spawns that are optional to destroy.  Realize that sometimes this accidentally occurs at warp-in. The Warp-In Beacon is 12km from the Ghost Ship, and your exact warp-in spot can be + or – 2.5km from this beacon.  If your warp-in does not land you within the 10km proximity, and if you don’t want to trigger these spawns, then be sure to head away from the Ghost Ship after warp-in.<br />

After taking care of the group of fighters, a rather large support fleet showed up. 10ish frigates + 12ish battleships. Took those down, started on the carrier, got the shields on that down when a new carrier spawned. And with the carrier another fleet of fighters, frigs, cruisers and battleships.

At warp in: 1 carrier, 8 fighters<br />
When the carrier was at around 50% shields and there where still a couple fighters left I got<br />
6 x Battleships<br />
5 x Frigates (Divine)<br />
<br />
At this point I had to warp out, moment I warped back in another spawn of<br />
6 x Battleships<br />
9 x Frigates (Divine)<br />
<br />
I’d say this is about the same spawn the previous poster had but I got it in 2 halves right after each other. I’m guessing these might be time based as we had different conditions cause them to spawn and I didn’t kill anything to cause the second one to spawn.<br />
<br />
I aldo didn’t get any more regular ships after those 2 spawns, it was all those 2 carriers and their fighter support. The second carrier could have been timed as well (just guessing, possibly wrong) but it seems to come in with it’s own set of 8 fighters at the same time as the first carrier launched a set of 5 fighters. Each carrier has 8 fighters initially and spawns 4 sets of 5 fighters at certain points.<br />
<br />
Carrier 1 Spawns<br />
~25% shields = 1 carrier 13 fighters<br />
0% shields = 5 fighters<br />
0% armour = 5 fighters<br />
50% hull = 5 fighters<br />
<br />
Carrier 2 spawns<br />
50% shield = 5 fighters<br />
50% armour = 5 fighters<br />
0% armour = 5 fighters<br />
50% hull = 5 fighters<br />
<br />
You can warp in at range during this mission, I found warping in the tank then warping in a pulse geddon at 50 to snipe the fighters worked well.<br />
Fighters can’t hit light drones as long as they are moving, a good way to manage the constant fighter spawns when attacking the carriers is to set some light drones on the carrier so when fighters spawn they will usually go after the drones<br />
Finally I have to say I don’t like carriers. It’s cool to kill them but fighters drop no loot and are a PITA to kill, carriers drop 1 x 5 mil tag and possibly some trade goods and take a hell of a lot of damage to take down. Might be fun to give this mission a go but carriers just don’t give good rewards.
