Initial Group aggros at warp-in.<br />
<strong>Killing the Mercenary Overlord battleship will trigger spawn.</strong><br />
<span class="notes"><br />
<strong><span class="underline"><span style="color: #dd0000; ">Warning</span></span></strong><br />
<ul><li> Normal space mission with no gate (you may select "warp-to" distance prior to visiting the mission area). You warp in near the initial position of the Mercenary Overlord battleship. When you kill it, the next wave with Web/scramble frigs and cruisers will spawn right on you.
</li><li> <strong><span style="color: #dd0000; ">The six Shadow's Grunt cruisers deal a high amount of EM damage.</span></strong> <a class="ext" href="http://npc.elfarto.com/view.php?id=12835">Shadow grunt</a>
</li><li> Spawn may aggro drones.
</li><li> Possible safe tactic: Warp in, align, kill Overlord, instantly warp out before scrambles lock on, then warp back at 50-100km, make sure you're outside of cruiser's range. Then aggro and use mwd to separate frigs. Count on webbing if frigs come too close! After this keep aligning of course.
</li><li> Alternatively: Select "warp-to" distance between 50-100 km, kill all the inital ships except the Overlord. Kill the overlords and then pick off the spawn as they approach.</li></ul>
</span><br />
<h4>Initial Group:</h4>

<span class="underline">Center (23km)</span><br />
1x Battleship (Mercenary Overlord - <em><strong>Trigger</strong></em>) <strong>Scourge Heavy Missile</strong> <br />
<span class="underline">Left (90-100km)</span><br />
6x Frigates (Mercenary Wingman) <strong>Web/Scramble</strong><br />
<span class="underline">Right (123-128km)</span><br />
4x Cruisers (Mercenary Lieutenant) <strong>Bloodclaw Light Missile</strong><br />
<br />
<h4>Spawn: (20-25km) </h4>

4x Frigates (Shadow's Wingman - Mercenary Wingman) <strong>Web/Scramble</strong><br />
6x Cruisers (Shadow's Grunt - Mercenary Commander) <strong>Scourge Heavy Missile</strong><br />
2x Battleships (Shadow's Goon - Mercenary Overlord) <strong>Scourge Heavy Missile</strong><br />
1x Battleship (Shadow - Mercenary Overlord) <strong>Scourge Heavy Missile</strong><br />
<br />
<h5>Tips</h5>

<ul><li> You can now warp in at any distance (not deadspace).  
</li><li> For Spawn : To reduce incoming DPS, eliminate the Mercenary Commanders first. Watch out for any scrambling frigates and shift your primary target accordingly.
</li><li> Mission is flagged completed after you have eliminated Shadow. Don't forget to loot (or buy from market) the 1x Report dropped (needed to complete the mission).
</li><li> Sniper-  warp to mission at 70km, main BS will be within 40km and reinforcement group over 100km out.  This prevents spawn groups from appearing next to you, respawn group will be 40km away as well making aggro and ships manageable.</li></ul>
<br />
<h5>Blitz</h5>

<ul><li> Eliminate the Mercenary Overlord battleship to trigger the spawn. Watch out for any incoming Mercenary Wingman frigates that web/scramble. 
</li><li> Eliminate Shadow. Loot (or buy from market) the 1x Report dropped and warp out.
</li><li> Note : The Report is not a specific item. This mission can be closed using any Report sold by NPC corps on the market.</li></ul>

<h5>Mining</h5>

32 Roids = 279,059 Veldspar<br />

I haven't gone and shot things yet, but I can't complete the mission with some random reports yet.  After re-reading, I assume you need to kill the Overlord then Shadow first.<br />

On a sidenote...  I wonder if this should be attempted in a Drake...

<span id="comment_353"></span>This mission may have been revised. You have the usual selection to warp within so many kilometers to start off. Once there the Groups appear as previously described, but at your selected distance. Group 2 spawn was 70-80 km from my ship. The next time I had this mission the distances were close to the above description.

<span id="comment_382"></span>You can use a drake in this mission,.. I had to only warp out onces,.. and that was after the second wave came in (they do hit hard). i just warped in at 70kms out and took them out. I recomend taking out the cruiser first as they are the ones with heavy damage in my opinion. I had only 4 tech 2 mods in my drake when i did this and i am sure i woulnd't have had to warp out at all had i all tech 2s in it.

<span id="comment_475"></span>This mission is not really problematic as long as you remember to tank the trigger ship whilst destroying that first spawn. After that you can decide to gain distance from the beacon by whatever means, even a new warp in.

<span id="comment_870"></span>I played the mission with a Drake, pretty low skills, most stuff is t1 best named. 282 defense and 245 offense were enough to get rid of all, shield never went below 75%. I agree with JupachA about the cruisers, they seem to do most damage.<br />
<br />
My fitting: 3 BCS II, 1 Beta SPR (best named t1) ; 2 therm, 1 kin, 1 invul (all t1 named), 2 LSE (also t1 meta4); 7 arbalest heavies, i used scourges.

In second spawn, launched hammerheads, took out BS's, then cruisers.  Was pretty quick and easy, killed everything in 10 minutes, loot took longer because that first set of cruisers started so far away.<br />

Confirmed that thermal damage is best as well.

<br />
Very short mission with good salvage, but a good one to lose a ship in if you're not careful. Lots of web/scram, so a bad fit (READ: Low Therm, EM or kin resist) will result in death.<br />
<br />
If you're concerned about your tank, kill everything at long range. Most of the DPS is &lt;15km. Again, watch out for the web/scram!

<br />
Expect very heavy laser DPS. If you go after the cruisers first they go down pretty fast but the 3 BS's in the second wave do a lot of DPS.

Only then did I take out the Overlord trigger. Since I had kited with AB on, the Spawn occurred 60km away. This made the mission so much easier. The frigs melted under my ACs, with help from my drones once they were in range. Then I flew directly at the BSs, melting the cruisers on my way. The BS took seconds flat to go down.<br />

<br />
In case anyone is interested, at about 300km from beacon the ships seem to stop and not go any further, it may be safe to shoot from anywhere beyond 300km. Beware that once you get beyond the 300km limit, since you will be out of the area, your drones will be torn to pieces since they will stay in with the enemy ships inside the 300km deadline. In my case I had to turn around and go back to the beacon kitting everything since I needed my drones to take down the frigs from spawn.

<br />
Fly at frigate group, when you can target them, do and open fire. By this point I was at about orbit range on trigger BS, cruisers still out of range, so orbited with AB, killed trigger. Started flying straight as reinforcements spawned - more than enough time with mix of drones and large AC to take out all the reinforcements that way, then original cruiser group before they got into light missile range.<br />
<br />
Took 22 minutes from accepting to hopping 3 jumps, killing all, getting Noctis, salvaging and back home handing mission in.<br />

For me the Veld was all local ~30km from warp-in location. If I'd had a miner nearby I might have gone for it.

<span id="comment_6859"></span>Pretty easy mission for a Kronos. Kronos can target up to 108km without fitting any additional modules, so you can kill all frigs and cruisers in the first group while they approach you. Send your drones to the trigger while sniping the small ships. Switch to Javelin for second spawn and each shadow grunt cruiser will pop after 1-2 shots. Fitting a faction webber is recommended to slow down the shadow BS in low orbit. Total time: ~5 min

<span id="comment_7006"></span>Word of warning. I got out this mission with 3% structure in a CN Raven. Killed all first pocket. Spawned the next got scrambled and stasis and next thing you know a CN Large Booster with CN Amp's with 70% resits just wasnt cutting it and i was being melted. Just got out with 3% structure, repaired warped back in at 70km and i was fine :) Becareful on this mission.

<span id="comment_7044"></span>As a counter to ExPOSED's experience, this one is laughably easy to blitz in a reasonably pimped CNR (about 1.2 bil). Warp in and align to sun, shoot BS and warp away. Warp back at 100km, align again and pop Shadow. Dock up w/ a Report purchased from the market. Simple ISK and acceptable LPs for about 10 mins of effort.

<span id="comment_7108"></span>Super easy mission but doesn't seems so at beggining.<br />
Blitz like SobrietyOKeeffe described above.<br />
But if you want easy ISK do like that:  when you jump back at 100km kill the frigates as they approach and you can easily kite the rest of rats. Takes 3 more minutes worth ~2,2 mil ISK in bounties. Do as you wish :)

The cruisers in the spawn appeared 50Kish away and it was easy to kill them before they got in range. Had Hob IIs on the frigates at the same time and cut through the lot of them very quickly.

<span id="comment_7640"></span>Went in at 100, which in my case put them out about 140km: sensor booster a must, sniping guns (in my case Tachyons with Aurora), damage boosts (3 heatsinks for me), AB gave me a little more time and helped get reports, tracking computer wouldn't have been bad. Frigates were popping at max range with one shot, cruisers with 2 or 3. Only ship that got a little closer, or even hit me (with his missile) was the trigger ship. Spawn slightly closer but easily taken out before anything got in range. Didn't need to run my booster, was never nervous. Nightmare.

I found no need to use the jump drive.<br />
1st wave is easy cakes, make sure to clear everything else before killing the BS.<br />
2nd wave applies heavy damage on their optimal range, so you'd want to kill them before they get there.<br />
target cruisers first, they have close to no tank, same with the BS<br />
use drones to get rid of them frigs, they didn't switch aggro for me, there was no scrambling for me either<br />
(my luck, as my internet decided to poop on me before i could kill the last frig)<br />

fly save~

<span id="comment_7963"></span>Ran this for the first time today.  My experience was different than some of the suggestions in the description....  I opted to warp to 100km hoping to have range off the web/scram frigs.  As it turns out, I dropped within 15km and was instantly webbed by all 6.  Fortunately, it was only webs, and I was able to warp out (they were WAY under my guns even changing out to tracking scripts, and the 7 T1 medium drones were not going to be able to deal with the problem in a timely manner).  I instead warped back into 0, and was about 80km from the frigs and, as advertised, 23 from the Overlord BS. At this point, the mission was easy.  I got instant agro from the frigs, but they were 80 km away.  So, I ABed directly away from the frigs and picked them off before they could even land any damage.  The Overlord got me to about 75% shields, but once the frigs were gone, I turned and got him in short order.  <br />
<br />
Now, and this is why it was easy, the spawn that triggered came in at about 80km (from my location at the time, I didn't note where it was in relation to the beacon).  I hit the cruisers first which were gone before they could land any damage at all.  Shadow and one of his goons were coming at me faster than the frigs, so I hit them next and then just cleaned up.  Due to the spacing of the spawns, I barely took any damage.  <br />

Warp in with a sniper ship. Kill the frigs ,then the cruisers, then the BS that is the trigger.  Same deal on second wave. Frigs first,cruisers next, then the BS. Nice mission with decent rewards given the time involved to complete. Not a nut buster. LOL<br />
