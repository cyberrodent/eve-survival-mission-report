<h3>Single Pocket All Spawns ~45-55km from warp-in point</h3>

<br />
Aggro a few seconds after you warp in<br />
<br />
6x Cruisers (Eom Prophet)<br />
<br />
<ul><li>Prophets spawn in three groups of two. When both prophets in a group are killed it triggers a spawn and its chain. It is recommended to target one from each group and kill them first. Then kill the remaining ships one at a time and eliminate the chain of spawns after it. <em>Note that this means you get a total of three of each of the Reinforcement Spawns!</em>
</li><li> An easy way to tackle this is to approach from either the left or right hand side and just pick off the ships as they approach.</li></ul>
<br />
<h4>Reinforcement Spawn 1</h4>

When you kill the cruiser, it triggers Reinforcement Spawn 2<br />
1x Frigate (Eom Demon)<br />
1x Cruiser (Eom Black Priest)<br />
<br />
<h4>Reinforcement Spawn 2</h4>

When you kill the cruiser, it triggers Reinforcement Spawn 3<br />
1x Frigate (Eom Succubus) <br />
1x Cruiser (Eom Crusader) <br />
<br />
<h4>Reinforcement Spawn 3</h4>

When you kill the cruiser, it triggers Reinforcement Spawn 4<br />
1x Frigate (Eom Succubus) <br />
1x Cruiser (Eom Crusader)<br />
<br />
<h4>Reinforcement Spawn 4</h4>

This is the final spawn<br />
2x Frigates (Eom Demon)<br />
1x Cruiser (Eom Death Knight)<br />
<br />
Example Image of how killing the Prophets triggers the Reinforcement Spawns:<br />

Make sure you do not turn the mission in until after you are done mining, if you want to mine. (Or just make sure there's always at least one ship in the area after you've turned it in.) Bookmarking the asteroids to warp in close doesn't work, you always warp to the start point unless mining after turning it in.<br />

<span id="comment_2853"></span>I active armor tank a myrmidon, and I easily took this mission on.  I do have hull upgrades 5, and mechanic 5, and repair systems five.  So all of my hardeners were tech 2, as well as my repper.  In all honesty I didn't even need the repper.  I just sat back and let my vespa 2's kill them all.  They wouldn't aggro my drones at all.

<span id="comment_3448"></span>This mission has been updated or is very random in numbers. There are a lot more ships now, and I counted more Plag asteroids too. I also lost 1 drone, it may have been the original group or an early spawn. I didn't have time to note triggers and wave numbers, but there were 6-9 ships at the start and they came in in small group spawns/triggers pretty rapidly after that. The mission is more difficult, but still easy enough in a reasonably fit Hurricane. It may be trouble for a cruiser. I didn't need to move so the &quot;at X km&quot; is to note where most of the type's wrecks were. Counting the wrecks after finishing there were:<br />
 EOM Prophet 6 maybe at 3000km<br />
Succubus 6   at 7500km<br />
Demon 9     at 7500km<br />
<br />
Crusader 6 at 15km<br />
black priest 3 at 18km<br />
death knight 3 at 17km<br />
<br />
Early ships Crusaders and Prophets spawn in waves but grouped together.<br />
Middle ships  Succubus and Black Priests....I think<br />
Ending ships Demons and Death Knights ...I think

<span id="comment_4066"></span>I started this mission with the intention of sitting in the middle of them and just tanking it with my myrmidon. After killing about 15 ships ran out of cap and had to retreat. They were much harder than I predicted. Also I noticed that kiting is not too effective. Their missiles deal good damage. Even at 50k while they seem almost uneffected by my railguns with iron ammo. Antimatter at close range is effective but drains my cap in a couple mins. Had to return to station twice to recharge my cap. The numbers of hostiles must be random. I was confronted by 33 ships.

<span id="comment_4105"></span>First few times I ran this mission, I carefully killed triggers so that i worked on each individual set of reinforcement waves before killing the next initial prophet.<br />
<br />
However, since I run this in my dual-rep drone myrm, I can usually sit there and tank everything while my Vespa II's chew everything up.  So I'm going to try &quot;afk'ing&quot; this mission this time around, see what happens to the drones.

<span id="comment_6391"></span>CAREFULLY READ THE DESCRIPTION AT THE TOP!! It tells you everything you need to know!!!<br />
- There are THREE sets of the listed spawns, as it says.<br />
- The triggers are not random!<br />
<br />
The first time I ran this, I didn't pay attention to triggers and quickly got overwhelmed. Had to warp out multiple times, etc.<br />
The second time I ran this, I just plunked my Harbinger (with relatively low skillpoints and no T2 guns) down in the middle and carefully triggered each set of spawns. Never had to warp out once, very easy and very rewarding.

<span id="comment_6487"></span>As several others have also noted, there is no drone aggro. Just make sure you watch what targets your drones attack, because they don't always pick the right ones.<br />
Incoming dps is pretty low as long as you kill enemies in the right order. Even a tech 1 fit battlecruiser should be able to tank this if fit properly. Good practice for a beginner.
