<div class="indent"><h3>A Stranger's Face</h3>
</div>
<br />
<div class="indent"><div class="indent">Your anger is understandable, but we've got more reason to cooperate than to quarrel. Dagan's your real enemy. You'll be interested to know that some of his corpmates have been spotted at a nearby station. We've prepared an agent to gain their confidence and extract information on their further operations. To you, she'll be Tahaki Karin, a ship's engineer from the Damsel. Before our operative can infiltrate Dagan's group, Karin's identity records will need to be altered. Take these records to an archive station. Once they're updated there, our friends will make sure they're changed throughout the entire network.</div></div>
<br />
<div class="indent"><div class="indent">Completion: Haul the <em>Altered Identity Records</em> to the designated location.</div></div>
<br />
<div class="indent"><h3>The Sisters and the Spy</h3>
</div>
<br />
<div class="indent"><div class="indent">With those records replaced, our agent <em>is</em> Tahaki Karin.<br />
What happened to real one? Electronically speaking, she's a non-person. She's alive and safe, though; if she wanted better, she shouldn't have joined the Society. Now, we need to get our Karin into place. I've filed a travel request in her name, which the Society has granted. All you need to do is rendezvous with a Society transport and drop her off.<br />
Once that's done, we just have to wait for her to tell us where Dagan is.</div></div>
<br />
<div class="indent"><div class="indent">Completion: Deliver <em>"Tahaki Karin"</em> to the <em>Luxury Spaceliner</em> docked at SOCT landing pad.</div></div>
<br />
<div class="indent"><div class="indent">Encounter type: Deadspace without gates.<br />
Warp to location. Approachthe landing pad, drop the "thing" into can.<br />
Don't, DONT DAMN SHOOT THE SHIP LEAVING LANDING PAD AFTER YOU COMPLETED THE MISSION.</div></div>
<br />
<div class="indent"><div class="indent"><span class="notes">Add: You'll get a popup from Republic Fleet representative offering cover for your final assignment.</span></div></div>
<br />
<div class="indent"><h3>Sealing the Deal</h3>
</div>
<br />
<div class="indent"><div class="indent">The Society of Conscious Thought has deployed a refitted cruiser, the <em>Omnipresence</em>, nearby... with a substantial escort. We think they may be recording our local communications. If they are, there's a good chance they'll be able to decipher them, and root out our agent. The Society will certainly murder our sister if they uncover her identity. We need you to locate the <em>Omnipresence</em>, and destroy her. If necessary, engage her escort, but try not to destroy them. The loss of human life would be catastrophic.</div></div>
<br />
<div class="indent"><div class="indent">Completion: Shoot down the <em>Omnipresence</em>.</div></div>
<br />
<div class="indent"><div class="indent">Encounter type: Deadspace without gates.<br />
Warp in, quickly approach the objective, set orbit, shoot it down, when you catch incoming fire - try to stay aligned to something. Finish off cruiser, warp away.</div></div>
<br />
<div class="indent"><div class="indent">Guards:<br />
<div class="indent">7x Frigates (Various assortment of Gallente ships)<br />
1x Cruiser (Society Spy) - the objective.</div></div></div>

<br />
<div class="indent"><h3>Chasing Shadows</h3>
</div>
<br />
<div class="indent"><div class="indent">An independent Amarr pilot named Kritsan Parthus has recently dealt with Dagan. Unfortunately, he won't disclose Dagan's location to the Sisters. Destroy Parthus's ship and retrieve him for questioning. </div></div>
<br />
<div class="indent"><div class="indent">Completion: Salvage <em>Kritsan Parthus</em> from his ship and bring him to agent.</div></div>
<br />
<div class="indent"><div class="indent">Encounter type: Deadspace without gates.<br />
Faction: Amarr (Independent Harbinger-class Battlecruiser), Angel (Independednt mercenary rookies)<br />
The battlecruiser objective has heavy EM/TM longrange DPS and heavy Energy Neutralizing inside 20km(?) range. The safest possible deal is to do this mission with help. Cleanup rookie frigates (they pop like chips) first. Then one should attract Kritsan and stay at maximum possible range from him, sustaining any incoming damage (armor tanking ships the best choice, additionally plated for resisting EM/Therm), the other should jump in close and do damage (EM Missiles/EM Drones/Lasers/Projectile with EMP will chew him fast).</div></div>
<br />
<div class="indent"><div class="indent">Guards:<br />
<div class="indent">5x Angel Rookie<br />
1x Battlecruiser (Kritsan Parthus) - the objective <span class="notes"><strong>Heavy DPS/Neut</strong></span>.</div></div></div>

<div class="indent"><div class="indent"><span class="notes">Add: You'll get a popup from Imperial Navy representative gently reasoning you... yet offering help for your final assignment.</span></div></div>
<br />
<div class="indent"><h3>The Missing Piece</h3>
</div>
<br />
<div class="indent"><div class="indent">We've finally determined Dagan's location. It appears that he's outfitting another expedition. If he successfully acquires more of those drones - and worse, maintains control of them - he and his clients will be able to wreak terrible destruction across the cluster. I'm sure you can take out Dagan yourself, but it looks like he's hired some muscle. You've made some imperial contacts, yes? They might be able to clear a path for you to engage Dagan.<br />
The empires will want Dagan not just for justice, but for his knowledge. Accept their help, but consider delivering him into our merciful hands, instead. We'll spare him... and make sure his knowledge does no harm. You have to make a choice between the Empires: Which one do you want to help you in taking down Dagan? </div></div>
<br />
<div class="indent"><div class="indent"><h4>Story arc branching</h4>
</div></div>
<br />
<div class="indent"><div class="indent">You have to choose from four empire commanders to hire one for the final battle. <span class="strikethrough">Your choice will directly affect key NPC abilities (I.e. his ship will be tuned to resist the damage kind your chosen empire relies upon), so make your choice wisely.</span> This has been tested inaccurate as of Incarna. His tank remains consistent regardless of choice.<br />
Each of four branches does not differ in meaning or treatment, so they are listed down here as one generic branch.</div></div>
<br />
<div class="indent"><h3>The &lt;Empire&gt; Commander</h3>
</div>
<br />
<div class="indent"><div class="indent">Completion: Head out to the representative of your choice.</div></div>
<br />
<div class="indent"><h3>Our Man Dagan</h3>
</div>
<br />
<div class="indent"><div class="indent">Completion: Retrieve <em>Dagan</em> and bring him to your agent.</div></div>
<br />
<div class="indent"><div class="indent">Encounter type: Deadspace with gate.<br />
Faction: Varies.<br />
<strong>Reward: &lt;selected faction/Empire&gt; Standings (+8.75% with Social Lvl 5)</strong><br />
<br />
<div class="indent"><div class="indent">Upon warp-in, you'll see a squad of your allied ships battling Dagan's escort frigates. They will leave as soon, as Dagan himself undock from station in his SOCT cruiser. As said earlier, Dagan's abilities will vary depends on your choice of empire ally, but some key moments will be the same: his tank will be very strong against primary weapon of the chosen empire (i.e. heavy EM/TM resists if you choose Amarr), and he will deal mostly the damage that is opposite to the choosen empire(?) (EX/KI, much like Minmatar or Angel ship).</div></div></div></div>
<br />
<div class="indent"><div class="indent">Guards:<br />
<div class="indent">3x Frigate<br />
1x SOCT Cruiser (Dagan)</div></div></div>
<br />
<div class="indent"><div class="indent">Here's some clues for battling him:<br />
<div class="indent"><h5>Choice of Amarr</h5>
 You'll face typical Angel cruiser. Close-range, mostly EX/KI damage and metric ton of EM/TM resists. Web him, stay over 10km and you'll be able to even shieldtank his guns in armortanked boat. I was.
</div><br />
Dagan's resistances are as follows:<br />
<div class="indent">Thermal - 81.3%<br />
Kinetic - 77.5%<br />
Explosive - 73.8%<br />
EM	- 85%</div></div></div>
<br />
<div class="indent"><h3>Dal Segno al Fine</h3>
</div>
<br />
<div class="indent"><div class="indent">The Sisters of Eve have requested that we turn Dagan to their forces as payment for their aid. The Sisters may appear peaceful, but we are providing this Society member no mercy by delivering him to their care.<br />
A Sisters of Eve convoy awaits the deliver of Dagan. They wish you to do the honors. I can think of no one more appropriate.</div></div>
<br />
<div class="indent"><div class="indent">Completion: Deliver <em>Dagan</em> to the awaiting Wreathe-class industrial.<br />
<strong>Reward: &lt;selected faction/Empire&gt; Standings (+8.75% with Social Lvl 5)</strong><br />
</div><br />
<div class="indent"><h4>Pocket 1</h4>
</div></div>
<br />
<div class="indent"><div class="indent"><div class="indent">Some distance from warp-in, you'll see a group of ships, supposedly representing the four empire commanders and Wreathe class hauler belonged to Sisters of Eve. Carefully aproach the hauler and drop <em>Dagan</em>/ in the hold. <strong>Head back to your agent and do nothing else at all.</strong><br />
<br />
</div>Amarr Faction Pop-up (will be different if you choose different faction):<br />
<span class="notes"><strong>Lear Evanus</strong> &gt; You have been an ally to the Empress and the Amarr people. Whether you continue your efforts defending the Empires or forge your own empires with your fellow capsuleers in the depths of lawless space, know that you have proven your worth as a capsuleer.</span><br />
<span class="notes"><strong>Sister Alitura</strong> &gt; Farewell. Perhaps there is hope for your kind yet.</span><br />

This Epic Arc is quite long, lots of jumping to do, and could be quite hard for a total noobie, but for a seasonned player it's not really that hard.
