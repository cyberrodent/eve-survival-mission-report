<h2>Part 2 of 2 </h2>

<br />
Faction: Caldari State<br />
Mission type: Encounter (Destroy the Caldari Supply Depot)<br />
Space type: Deadspace<br />
Damage dealt: Kin/therm<br />
Extras: Target jamming (Taibu State Tachi/Tendai/Sohei)<br />
Web/scramble: unknown<br />
Recommended damage dealing: kin/therm<br />
Recommended ships: Tengu, Maelstrom, Raven, Rattlesnake, Dominix/DNI<br />
Difficulty: Medium <br />
<br />
<h3>Single Pocket</h3>

<br />
No aggro on warp-in.<br />
<br />
<h4>Wave 1 (50km)</h4>

1x Taibu State Tachi Frigate (ECM) - will aggro cruisers when fired on<br />
2x State Shukuro Samurai Cruisers <strong>Wave 2 trigger</strong>  - can be aggroed alone<br />
3x State Shukuro Bajo Battlecruisers - can be aggroed alone<br />
4x State Shukuro Daijo BS - orbits at 35km<br />
2x State Shukuro Bishamon BS <strong>Wave 3 trigger</strong> - orbits at 34km<br />
<br />
<h4>Wave 1</h4>

Triggered (if Wave 1 is alive and) the supply depot has lost about 25% armor.<br />
<br />
2x Taibu State Tendai/Sohei Cruisers (ECM)<br />
<br />
<h4>Wave 2a </h4>

3x Cruisers  - will cause BS aggro when fired upon<br />
<br />
<h4>Wave 2b </h4>

Timed trigger after the three cruisers before (?)<br />
<br />
3x Taibu State Suriage/Shirasa Frigates (Web/Scram)<br />
<br />
<h4>Wave 3</h4>
 
2x State Shukuro Bishamon BS<br />
2x State Shukuro Shogun BS <strong>Wave 4 Trigger</strong> - orbits at 33km<br />
<br />
<h4>Wave 4</h4>
 
2x <a class="ext" href="http://npc.elfarto.com/view.php?id=28171">State Shukuro Nagashin BS</a>  (Heavy Thermal damage, orbit at 67500 m. ) <br />
Nagashins move relatively slowly so if you move closer to their spawn point you can approach them after they spawn and destroy them before they get out of range.<br />
<br />
Alternative to Wave 3 ( If you destroy the depot first then the initial Bishamons will not cause Wave 3 as listed, instead the last Dajo triggered a 4 Bishamon spawn and the regular Wave 4 triggered by the last Bishamon.<br />
<br />
Mission completes when supply depot is destroyed.<br />
<br />
<h5>Structures</h5>

<ul><li> Caldari Supply Depot - 255,000 hp, mission completion trigger.</li></ul>
<br />
<h5>Tip</h5>

<ul><li>  Heavy use of missiles. Using defender missiles can help mitigate some of the damage.	</li></ul>
<br />
<ul><li>  Destroying the supply depot incurs no standing penalty.
</li><li> If you want to blitz (i.e. destroy the supply depot without attacking any ships to avoid losing Caldari standings), you will need to permatank around 850-900 dps of 75% Kin/25% Therm damage because the whole initial group will attack you. If your ship has low sensor strength (e.g. Marauders, Command Ships, T3s), you will need to bring high-damage drones (Vespa 2 or Hammerhead 2), because the ECM cruisers can keep you jammed much of the time.
</li><li> Droneboat with Sentries works great, just get Aggro and let the Sentries (Bouncer II or Warden II) attack the Depot, orbit your own Sentries to reduce Missile/Torp-Damage and just ignore the NPCs and the jamming. If your tank holds (no problem with anti Kin/Therm-Setup), you don't have to care for the ECM and do not get a standing hit to Caldari State.</li></ul>
<br />
<span class="underline">Tags to be looted (can vary slightly):</span><br />
<br />
Caldari Navy Admiral x 16<br />
Caldari Navy Captain II x 3<br />
Caldari Navy Captain III x 1<br />
Caldari Navy Commodore I x 4<br />
Caldari Navy Commodore II x 20<br />
<br />
<span class="underline">Standing loss:</span><br />
0.02% from Caldari State per standing tick<br />
No loss for destroying the depot!<br />

<span id="comment_894"></span>In Part 2, Wave 4, the final Nagasin BS retreated went far beyond 70-75k. He went out to about 90k then started orbiting, but slowly going farther out. Kind of a pain because he got out of my Raven's targeting range and it wasn't worth my while to run him down. Means I got zilch from part 2 since I couldn't go back and salvage it, and there were no bounties.

<span id="comment_1050"></span>I wasn't going to farm it but I did notice Part 1 would be hard to farm nicely since the Mission Objective drops with this trigger - &quot;3x Battleships (Mordus Sequestor) Killing the last one triggers wave 2&quot;. Also for me the Abandoned Containers have not been worth the time spent looting them. The Mordus Fleet Commander seems to be a rather unlikely possibility up to this point as well.

<span id="comment_1127"></span>For the second part, you can snipe off the supply depot without too much trouble from the NPCs, as they are fairly easy to tank. Not much point to kill the npcs, as they dont have bounty, loot isnt too great (cept for tags), and the salvage is garbage mostly.

<span id="comment_1299"></span>Part I: make sure you bring enough firepower to crack the mammoth's shield tank. It's deep with an active recharger. Large guns/cruise should be able to do it, but it could take a long, long time with crap guns and T1 ammo. And getting in close will be tough without a phoon or an AB.

<span id="comment_1449"></span>On part 2 of this mission, I was unable to tank the final two Nagasin battleships, even after going back and refitting for more thermal than kinetic resistance, and I couldn't even get through the shields of one of them before having to warp out. They use turrets only, and do severe damage especially when they get wrecking hits. Even going 400m/s with an afterburner didn't help. I had to wait until after downtime so the mission reset and go back. Then I killed the ECM frigate, 4 of 5 battlecruisers, 3 of 6 battleships, parked next to the supply depot and easily tanked the remaining first-wave ships while pounding the station to bits.

<span id="comment_1557"></span>Hello, Fellow missioneers.<br />
My experiences with part 1 of this mission differ from what is stated above: <br />
up to now, I flew the mission only twice but both times the can first dropped from the last remaining battleship (a Mordus Phanti in both my cases)<br />
<br />
And for part 2: Warp in, tank stage, close in on depot, hurl drones and missiles at the depot, kill depot, warp out did the trick. Jamming has not been that bad or I was just lucky. It took me with my medium damage skills on my alt 2 reloads on my CNR with 7CN-Cruises (30 missiles payload each) - so YES, loads of HP on this depot, but to no avail ;)<br />
<br />
2 tips for those secondes while being jammed: Drones stay on target and keep on pounding it! reload while being jammed saves you precious time for firing missiles!

<span id="comment_2018"></span>The item from the first part drops from the last ship. That's right - the last ship, not the last battleship. Keep the three frigates alive that circle you at 2km and kill them last, meaning you get the item without having to move a single meter.

<span id="comment_2348"></span>Just did that one the first time; part 1 is rather easy, in part 2 jamming from that lone frig is indeed not too bad - here and there it strikes, you re-lock, end of story. DPS however is remarkable, at least if you want to tank ALL rats without killing any. My first setup has a tank (according to EFT) of some 530 against Caldari et al, and it broke (though it took some time). Refitting for maximum tank (roughly 1200 DPS) did the job easily, shields went down to maybe 66 % (passive tank).

<span id="comment_3808"></span>The Second Part has changed a bit<br />
<br />
Firing on anything seems to aggro the entire room.<br />
<br />
Upon Firing on the 3 Cruisers in wave 2, a wave of 3 frigates will spawn and one of these will web/ scramble you.<br />
<br />
In Wave 3 often all of the BS are the same, they will appear as a group of 4 then the trigger will usually break off from the group at about 50km<br />
<br />
Finally when you attack the depot when you get the depot into about 75% armor 2 cruisers will spawn and both will distrupt you so you cannot target. I took care of both of these with drones on aggressive before continuing to destroy the depot.

<span id="comment_4881"></span>Part 1: Done this in maelstrom. Had 1x kinetic and 1x thermic shield hardener but it wast enough. I had to come back and fit one invulnerability field cause I ran out of cap with only 2. Also I needed EMP L to shoot 1mil bounty BS.

<span id="comment_5000"></span>Just had part II again after a looong time and BOY did the dps increase since then! My Vargur almost got torn apart by the incoming stuff, had to speed tank around them and take them apart one by one with the ACs... doing that made it all easy again. Spiraling in at speed 400 almost nullified the entire damage.

<br />
Part 2 - Blitzed with active cap stable Golem. I didn't shoot a single ship, was jammed maybe 3 times.  I didn't want to take any faction hit for caldari, it seems to have worked.<br />

<span id="comment_5263"></span>Part2 Nagasin pwn:<br />
<br />
If you have trouble with the Nagasin-s, leave wave 4 trigger alive and reaload, then when you kill it, rush one of the Nagasins, web it, and orbit at 500m! They have long range weapon, so it's half dmg to tank already.  Then depending on your setup, you will have a high rad/s low speed and a hi distance hi speed target to choose.

<br />
I can confirm the results reported by VlosKtonos.  *If* you can blitz the supply depot (a very big &quot;if&quot;), then you can complete the mission without getting a standing loss with the Caldari State.  A -0.0% will show up for &quot;Combat - Aggression&quot;, but no &quot;Combat - Ship Kill&quot;.<br />
<br />
I dual-account missions in battleships, nowadays, so I was able to put out the necessary DPS against the supply depot.  I'm guessing that incoming damage peaked at around 800-850 pre-resistance Kinetic and Thermal damage, but I can't be sure.

<span id="comment_5876"></span>Easiest way to do Part II: Dominix with 2x LAR II, 2x Kin/2x Therm Hardener + Damage Control. Warp in, get Aggro, Drop Bouncer II and engage the Depot (orbit your Bouncers at 2500 to reduce Torp Damage). Then go get something to drink, eat, play with the dog or whatever.<br />
Since the NPC cannot break your tank ever and jamming does not reduce your DPS, your drones simply finish the depot after a few minutes. Scoop them and warp out, mission complete without any hassle or standing hit.

<span id="comment_5889"></span>Both parts completed solo in a faction frigate (Dramiel)<br />
<br />
Part 1 took 50m mins, no problems other than needed RF EMP to take down the Mordus Mammoth.<br />
  I only got 1,884,908 units of veldspar, mined within 55 mins using Orca and two hulks,so was able to collect time bonus.<br />
 Veld amounted to around 17.4m<br />
<br />
Part 2 was harder, I opted for the blitz, speed tanking was easy, however the two ECM Jamming Cruisers had me locked down completly, 3x T2 drones did not take down the ECM Cruiser in over 5 mins, had to rethink approach, fitted 3x Ladar Backup Arry II's (giving a total of 23.1 Sensor Strength) removing 3x Republic Fleet Gyros to make space for them (dropped my DPS by about 35%) so it ended up taking quite some time to complete the mission.<br />
<br />
The Sensor Boosters gave me enough of a window to get lock on the Two ECM cruisers and take them down.<br />
<br />
I did not see wave 1b so the trigger is likely to be linked to atticking the other ships.

<span id="comment_7261"></span>Re: 2/2- This is not a particularly easy or quick mission, and not that well paying. The 15M in tags is the only plus factor, but not enough for me considering the standing hit. 0.06% loss in total, I did the full/slow version to get the tags though.

<span id="comment_7733"></span>Not easy solo even with a higher (32M) SP character in a Machariel if you don't manage the aggro.<br />
All the rats in part 2 are more vulnerable to Kinetic than anything else, but thermal is the better ammo because of the much higher pre-defense damage.<br />
After all was said (shot) and done, I flew away with just over 55.8 million isk in loot.
