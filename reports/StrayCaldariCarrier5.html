<h5>Tips</h5>

<ul><li> Mission occurs in normal space, so you can always warp to distances and to bookmarks farther away from the NPCs. 
</li><li> Your first warp attempt will be a forced Warp to 0. Even if you select Warp to 100 you will arrive at the Warp-In Beacon 
</li><li> Try selecting warp, canceling your warp, then warping to your desired distance 
</li><li> Warping to within 100km leaves plenty of distance that spreads out the aggro 
</li><li> Cruise Missile Batteries have a maximum range of 170km, and the Carrier’s NOS has a maximum range of 150km 
</li><li> Fighters will immediately attack your drones when they spawn from the Carrier, but this can be used to your advantage 
</li><li> Small Drones are invulnerable to the Fighters, as long as they are moving/attacking; and they are a great way to draw-off the Fighters aggro. Have your small drones attacking the carrier when the fighters spawn. 
</li><li> The Fighters are only be able to hit Large and Medium drones 
</li><li> Mission is flagged complete when the Carrier and Fighters are destroyed. You do not need to destroy the Cap Ship Maint Array</li></ul>

<span id="comment_3213"></span>I just completed this mission with a friend of mine. We used four ships. A passive tanked Drake, a shield repping Domi, a shield repping Raven, and a cruise Raven. Yeah, you may be thinking &quot;A repping Raven?&quot; Anyway. The DPS this mission gives out is incredible. The repping Raven was sent in just incase the Domi couldn't handle the repping himself. Then if the Domi could handle it, the Raven would go refit. <br />
<br />
Turned out the Domi couldn't rep him alone even though he was repping 2400+ shields every 4.5 seconds. The Raven helped. After everything was cleared out except the BS's the Raven pilot went and refit.<br />
<br />
I used this guide to help me complete this mission and must say it was fairly accurate. However, once I hit the carrier and found out it had quite a bit of HP, something insane happened, well not really, I became bored. I immediately tried different missile types and found explosive to deal more damage than kin/therm. Approximately 23% more.<br />
<br />
For the carrier I strongly recommend switching to explosive damage. Cheers.

<span id="comment_7889"></span>i got a gallente variant of this mission, didn't see a writeup so I thought I'd post it here. Pretty much verbatim like this one, just different named rats. I used 2 tengus at first until most of the dps ships were removed then cleaned up the carrier and its fighters with 2 gilas. Couple of notes -  <br />
<br />
240HP/s passive gila had a little incident. I was orbiting my sentries when they got aggrod and i scooped them, which caused gila to stop moving momentarily. By the time i sped back up shield recharge was struggling to keep up but recovered with traversal. <br />
<br />
A lot of frigs to kill at first, so make sure nobody is scanning for you as the first min or two, there is no chance to warp out even with precisions and hobgoblins going to town. <br />
<br />
Capacitor recovers to about 5 units in between neuting cycles of the carrier, but when the neuting towers spawn they seem to be on a different cycle so warping out gets tricky (0 to 1 capacitor left at times trololo)
