<br />
<h3>Pocket 1</h3>

Empty<br />
<br />
<h3>Pocket 2</h3>

2x Spider Drone I<br />
1x Battleship (<a class="ext" href="http://npc.elfarto.com/view.php?id=12392">Khanid Mashtori</a>) <br />
<br />
Drops 2x Khanid Royal Insignia (worth 1m each)<br />
<br />
<h3>Pocket 3</h3>

<h4>Left Group (Kill this 1st)</h4>

3x Battleships (State Oshiro/Zen (Scorpion/Juggernauts))<br />
2x Cruisers (Taibu State Sohei/Tendai (Blackbird/Flameburst missiles/A lot of ECM))<br />
3x Frigates (Taibu State Daito/Yari (Kestrel/Thorn Rockets/Webs))<br />
<br />
<h4>Right Group (Kill this 2nd)</h4>

3x Cruisers (Taibu State Samurai (Moa/Scourge missiles))<br />
3x Battlecruisers (State Oni/Kanpaku (Ferox/Scourge missiles)) <br />
<br />
<h4>Middle Group (Kill this 3rd)</h4>

3x Frigates (Taibu State Nagasa/Shinai (Crow (?)/Thorn Rocket/Web/Scramble))<br />
4x Cruisers (State Shukuro Chugen/State Shikuro Ashigaru (Blackbird/Scourge))<br />
3x Battleships (Caldari Navy Temuras (Raven/Juggernauts)) - Orbit at 50km<br />
<br />
4x Caldari Cruise Missile Battery <br />
<br />
Destroy the manufacturing plant! <strong>(Mission Completion when destroyed)</strong><br />
<br />
<h2>Hints</h2>

Attacking the missile batteries will aggro the whole pocket. When you attack the left group, one of the CM battery will open fire on you, do not engage it!<br />
Don't forget to destroy the manufacturing plant (which drops 100 units of Garbage)!<br />
It's doable with low (40%) EM resist as long as you have a good buffer, the first battleship dies relatively fast.<br />
It is recommended that you bring a salvager to this mission as the tags + salvage actually makes up a large amount of the mission's profit.<br />
If you cannot deal with the ships in the pocket, fit a sniping fit and shoot at the plant from 150 KM+, the ECM should not hit you at all, and if they become an issue simply snipe them first and kite around. <br />
<br />
<span class="underline">Standing loss:</span><br />
0.02% loss with the Caldari State for for destroying "Caldari State's Khanid Mashtori"<br />
0.02% loss with the Caldari State per standing tick (15 minutes) after that<br />
2.4% loss for destroying the manufacturing planet<br />
<br />
<span class="underline">Tags to be looted:</span><br />
Caldari Navy Admiral x 9<br />
Caldari Navy Captain II x 3<br />
Caldari Navy Captain III x 3<br />
Caldari Navy Commodore I x 9<br />

Caldari Navy Vice Admiral x 3<br />

<span id="comment_40"></span>Using a dual repper Domi with Bouncer Is, and then switching to Ogre Is, I could not break the Temuras' tanks.  But they could not break mine either.  I kill everything else, let the Ogres occupy one Temura whilst I destroyed the manufacturing plant.  The Temuras do not need to be killed in order complete the mission.

<span id="comment_170"></span>Completed with Nighthawk.  Tank isn't an issue at all, but the Temuras take a little while to go down.  ~160 missiles each, T2 launchers w/ Scourge + Hobgoblin II's.  Be aware that many of the enemies in the last pocket, including the Temuras, like to hang back at 45 - 55km, so bring a drone link if you've got a spare high.

<span id="comment_305"></span>I tried this in a Domi with 3 x 250mm Prototype Gauss and 3 x 250mm Compressed Coil, plus Magnetic Vortex stabiliser (giving extra 20% firepower), using Federation Navy Antimatter M ammo (extra 15% over std Antimatter). With Ogre 1s, I was just holding the Temura shield tank, at around 30-35%. Switching to Wasp 1s (Kinetic damage) took them out in a few mins each.

<span id="comment_349"></span>When attacking the Left group, the Tendai's will nail you with ECM. If, like me, you can't keep anything targeted then target them and send your drones as soon as you have one targeted. Rinse and repeat for the other one.<br />
Once they're gone, you'll have a far easier time taking out the rest...

Using Wasps I, it is a piece of cake, only the jamming of the left group is a bit disturbing.

<span id="comment_796"></span>Attacking one of the missile batteries aggro'd the whole room for me so be aware.<br />
<br />
Key to this mission is the Wasps as stated, just load up for kinetic there's only the one Khanid BS anyway and it's the only BS in that pocket.  <br />
<br />
I fit my Phoon with 2xLAR, 2xKin Hard, 1xTherm Hard, 1xEANM and tanking was not a problem.

<span id="comment_1440"></span>Khanid Mashtori really does pack a punch.  I recommend doubling up on your EM resists if you can.  both Khanid and the Caldari ships do a lot of EM dmg.<br />
<br />
10:21:27 Combat Khanid Mashtori aims well at you, inflicting 159.4 damage.<br />
10:21:41 Combat Paradise Cruise Missile belonging to Caldari State hits you, doing 531.6 damage.<br />
<br />
The turrent dmg happens about every 2.6 seconds while the paradise missile dmg happens every 15+ seconds.  The 531.6 missile dmg is with 66.25% EM resist.<br />
<br />
Loot is lame, but good tags. Salvage is decent.

Tanks of the Battleships were no problem. Frigs and Cruisers are drone food. Only the manufacturing plant took me a little longer; about 400 Missiles I guess.

<span id="comment_3148"></span>The only thing to watch out for is the Tendais and the Temuras. The former will target jam you, the latter have a substantial tank. The most obnoxious part about this mission is the manufacturing plant... it took about 700 standard cruise missiles to down. I think i'll be declining this one in the future.

<span id="comment_3978"></span>I got jamming from the Soheis. There were no Tendais in my mission.<br />
<br />
The tank on the Temuras is impressive, but it's all shield. it took 25 rounds to break through their shields, and then one, two, three, FOUR shots to drop their armor.<br />
<br />
For the Manufacturing Plant, I recommend leaving it for the very last and then returning to the station to switch out your armor tank from damage increasing modules.

<span id="comment_6610"></span>Be sure to bring the appropriate damage-dealing ammo/drones and you'll be fine.  Kinetic for 99% of the stuff here (Caldari).  The Manufacturing Plant has an absurd amount of HP and you just have to sit and burn it down with whatever highest DPS stuff you have (no resists).

<span id="comment_8362"></span>decided to try it with no EM resists, just kin/therm. no problems with tank. shield booster easily kept up with the mashtori until it died. left it off for most of pocket 3 since I was only getting hit for single digit damage.<br />
one thing to note...i believe i proximity aggroed the center group while i was chasing down the left group. <br />
for me all spawns were 60+ km from landing spot (pocket 3). I didn't realize this before hand or I would have fit heavy missles instead of HAMs. burned through over 3000 scourge hvy assault missles (including factory).
