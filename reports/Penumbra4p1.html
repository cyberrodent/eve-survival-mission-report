<br />
<hr />

<h3><span class="underline">Mission 5A</span> - Two Steps Into Hell</h3>

Deliver S.I. Formula Sheet to the Nugoeihuvi Cargo Facility in KFR-ZE (Syndicate) in Null Security.<br />
No fighting involved.<br />
<br />
<div class="indent">Mission location is over 30 jumps.<br />
Tip: Use a nano fitted MWD interceptor, since Syndicate is usually bubbled and almost always camped.</div>
<br />
<br />
<hr />

<h3><span class="underline">Mission 5B</span> - Playing It Safer</h3>

Deliver S.I. Formula Sheet to the Nugoeihuvi Cargo Facility in Faurulle (Solitude) in Low Security. On the NOH storyline this mission will remove the option to choose 'The Crimson Decoy' and the next mission will be 'Pre-Emptive Opportunities'.<br />
<br />
<div class="indent">Mission location is over 30 jumps. If path goes through Null Sec, Interceptor is recommended.<br />
Low Sec is very risky. Nano Interceptor or fast and agile Frigate is recommended. Cloak will also help. Beware of pipebomb camps or remote sensor booster camps (instalock).</div>
<br />
<br />
<hr />

<h3><span class="underline">Mission 5C</span> - An Honorable Betrayal</h3>

Report to Arikio Kuretsu in Wuos (Wuos V - Moon 1 - Hyasyoda Corporation Mining Outpost) in High Security. (Make sure to bring S.I Formula Sheet)<br />
<br />
<br />
<hr />

<h3><span class="underline">Mission 5C.1</span> – Proof of Intent</h3>

Once you report to Arikio Kuretsu in Wuos, you explain to him what NOH is having you do in regards to his corporation. He then has a lengthy explanation about how Hyasyoda has nothing to do about these things. To complete this mission you have to give the agent the S.I Formula Sheet.<br />
<br />
<br />
<hr />

<h3><span class="underline">Mission 5C.2</span> – Return to Isha</h3>

Arikio Kuretsu sends you back to Poinen, where you then get 'Re-examining Options', see Mission 4 'The Paths That Are Hidden' for details. This also unlocks the Hyasyoda story arc branch after you complete either one. (Don’t forget the S.I Formula Sheet)<br />
<br />
<br />
<hr />

<h3><span class="underline">Mission 5C.3</span> – Re-examining Options</h3>

You will be given the choice between 'Two Steps Into Hell' (Null Sec) and 'Playing It Safer' (Low Sec). <br />
<br />
-<br />
<br /> <br />
<h3><span class="underline">Mission 6</span> (Hyasyoda Branch) - Almost Unmasked</h3>

Report to Arikio Kuretsu in Wuos (Wuos V - Moon 1 - Hyasyoda Corporation Mining Outpost).<br />
<br />
<br />
<hr />

<h3><span class="underline">Mission 7</span> - Some Light Theatrics</h3>

In this mission, you have to make NOH think that the CPF compound they are watching has been destroyed. You have to hack into the electronic surveillance(a CPF Habitation Module) and take the security forces out before it explodes, and then return to the agent. You have to be quick however, as the CPF compound explodes about 30 seconds after you hack into it, and if you fail to retrieve the CPF Security Personnel you will fail the mission.<br />
<br />
<br />
<hr />

<h3><span class="underline">Mission 8</span> - Untouchable</h3>

Report to Katsen Isha in Poinen (Poinen IV - Moon 13 - Nugoeihuvi Corporation Development Studio).<br />

<ul><li> If you want to engage the ships and collect Navy Tags you will get negative standing hits for ship kill / aggression. The ships don't do a lot of damage up close. Best to align out as soon as the Gallente Navy Sin Battleship spawns to gain range. The Gallente Navy Arazu Cruiser fires Thunderbolt missiles which put out a lot of EM damage, so fit your tank accordingly.</li></ul>
<br />
<strong><span class="underline">Blitz</span></strong><br />
<ul><li> Quickly approach and activate Newly Constructed Acceleration Gate (Not locked). No need to engage Gallente ships. </li></ul>

<span id="comment_3008"></span>It seems that your choice for mission 5 also determines which of the alternate Mission 7's will be chosen. I chose 'Playing it Safer' and got 'Pre-Emtive Opportunities' as mission 7. I suspect 'An Honorable Betrayal' leads to 'The Crimson Decoy' and the other two to 'Pre-Emptive Opportunities.<br />
Completed M7 in a CNR with Navy fittings with a general tank. First two waves do not target drones, but third (or forth) did, so be prepared to retract them. No scrammers as far as I could see. Lots of loot, but poor salvage.

<span id="comment_3357"></span>Just want to make a note here, as I may come back and fill in a report, &quot;A Generals Best Friend&quot;, the Gallente Navy Arazu fire Thunderbolts and push a huge amount of EM damage, the RoF is very slow though so a high kin/therm tank and EM if you have room. I managed to rep the damage away before the next volley.

<span id="comment_8050"></span>I collected all Information on Rewards, loot and completion times.<br />
For calculation of loot values, I took the in game inventory value (Juni 2014)<br />
The Values are from 3 chars, doing the complete arc, killing everything. So loot and salvage should be quite reliable, since i took the value of the loot/salvage of all 3 and divided it by 3<br />
<br />
salvage: 12 mil<br />
loot: 115 mil<br />
final reward (mobile lab): 332 mil<br />
mission rewards + bonus: 140 mil<br />
bountys for killing all npcs: 15 mil<br />
<br />
total: 614 mil<br />
<br />
I also measured the time, the arc required for completion killing all npcs and traveling without autopliot in a BS. I used a Vargur with faction/T2 fit (850-900 dps) and an alt with T3&amp;Noctis für Hacking/Salvaging.<br />
Some of the missions can be blitzed, saving some time (maybe 30 minutes in total) but reducing loot/salvage by 45 mil.<br />
<br />
duration: 4:30 hours<br />
<br />
I will add these information for the other arcs as soon as I completed them for comparison.
