<h3>Path To Enlightenment - Deception (1 of 3)</h3>

<br />
<strong>Background</strong>:I am a professor of archaeology at the University of Caille. Behind this ancient gate beside me you will find one of the most fascinating enigmas in existence. It is a small and seemingly insignificant object, but one that holds massive powers. The origin of this relic is still vague, though most now agree that it was built by the Yan Jung nation. Perhaps you've heard of it? The Yan Jung nation immigrated into our world through the EVE Gate eons ago. From where, we do not know, though the fragments of texts we've managed to translate talk about a mysterious middle kingdom. They settled here in Deltole, though we suspect they also colonized other systems, even in far off places. But what we've uncovered so far is here in the Deltole system, especially on Deltole V and VI, which seem to have been much more inhabitable back then.<br />
<br />
So what happened to the Yan Jung nation, you must be wondering? Simply told, we don't know yet. Heck, I'm not even sure what the relic I just described to you was used for. I've been studying it for months and still its purpose eludes me. It has some sort of a repelling force that's almost impenetrable. It also has regeneration mechanics and perpetual power source, meaning it's as good as eternal. What the Yan Jung built it for, or used it for, is a complete mystery.<br />
<br />
Unfortunately, the Serpentis pirates have taken an interest in Yan Jung relics too. They've sent out dozens of treasure hunters and scavengers. They don't tolerate others to interfere with their efforts, which explains why I'm hiding out here instead of being at the relic studying it. The Serpentis periodically send expeditions here and are always scouting the place. Their methods are crude, but they've got much more manpower and resources than I can ever dream of having. I've heard rumors that they've uncovered an important piece of the biggest riddle surrounding the Yan Jung nation. Over at Deltole X, close to the stargate leading to Colelie, is the entrance point to a Yan Jung site that is possibly the largest Yan Jung ruins in space still in existence. I can only imagine what riches might await there. The only problem is that a passkey is needed to activate the gate. And from what I've heard the Serpentis are now in possession of one of the key elements in constructing one.<br />
<br />
You look like an energetic pilot. I'm interested in hiring you for a bit of work. The Serpentis relic hunters are operating from a base within the Skeleton Comet site here in Deltole. I haven't been there myself, but somewhere within it you'll find a Serpentis Survey Site, which is the right place. Therein the Serpentis store all the data and items they've found throughout the whole constellation. What I want you to search for is a map of some sort. I'm sorry for being so vague, but that's all the info I have. I'm sure you'll know what I want as soon as you see it. There's only one problem. The Serpentis are a paranoid lot, and they've encrypted all their data and storage containers. I hope you possess some hacking skills, or know someone that does, for that is what is required to get to the information I need. Get that map from the Serpentis and bring it to me and I will reward you handsomely. I feel dirty having to resort to petty theft, but when you're up against scumbags such as the Serpentis the only way to play a fair game is to follow their rules.<br />

<h3>Path To Enlightenment - Destruction (2 of 3)</h3>

<br />
<strong>Background</strong>:The map you got me is only one piece in the puzzle of getting into the hidden relic site. You remember what I told you about that strange device that lies behind this gate beside me? It is of Yan Jung origin and I believe it can give us another vital puzzle piece. In order for me to construct a usable passkey to enter the relic site I need to understand better how the Yan Jung nation approached technology. The force repeller has a micro processor, which would give me just those insights. I am a hopeless fighter, so I don't stand a chance against the Serpentis ruffians in there. I need someone of your capabilities to get the micro processor for me.<br />
<br />
So what you need to do is enter the Yan Jung ruins through the gate beside me. Take out the Serpentis scouts and proceed to tackle the force repeller. You can't get close to it while it's still active, so you need to shoot it from a distance. Once it blows up get the micro processor quickly before the regeneration nano-bots kick in and rebuild the repeller. Oh, and one more thing. The Serpentis periodically send expeditions to the ruins. I hope you don't run into them, but if you do make sure you have plenty of firepower on your side.<br />
<br />
<strong>Bring Item Objective</strong><br />
Acquire these goods:<br />
 		Drop-off Location	0,5 Mathon's Helios in Deltole.<br />
 		Item	1 x Yan Jung Micro Processor (1,0 m³)<br />
<br />

The following rewards will be yours if you complete this mission:<br />
 	800 000 ISK<br />
<br />
<strong>Bonus Rewards</strong><br />
The following rewards will be awarded to you as a bonus if you complete the mission within 2 hours<br />
<div class="indent">1 x 'Love' Medium Remote Armor Repairer Blueprint (3 runs, copy, material level: 15, productivity level: 6)</div>
<br />
<br />
<h3>Path To Enlightenment - Discovery (3 of 3)</h3>

<br />
<strong>Background</strong>:The Yan Jung were more clever than I gave them credit for, it seems. The micro processor is highly advanced and my analytical methods are limited in cracking its secrets. However, what little information I've managed to glean from the processor gives me hope that we can still solve this mystery. The encryption methods employed by the Yan Jung nation are in many ways similar to those used by a new strand of rogue drones that a colleague of mine have told me exist in this very constellation. My guess is that the rogue drones happened upon some lost Yan Jung artifact here in Algintal and in assimilating it learned some new tricks.<br />
<br />
But however it happened is beside the point. What really matters is that the local pirates that frequent the asteroid belts here in Algintal have been harassing this new breed of drones out of fear it will grow to become too powerful for them to handle. And as pirates usually do, the loot those they destroy. This colleague of mine has been doing a research on this new rogue drone breed and he tells me that the drones have developed a sophisticated binary code to interact with the Yan Jung technology they assimilated. My theory is that if we get this binary code we can use it to unravel the mysteries of the micro processor in my possession. In doing so we should have no problem in constructing a useable passkey. And the belt pirates, having hunted the new drones so excessively, are certain to possess this binary code.<br />
<br />
In essence, I want you to go into the asteroid belts and hunt down belt pirates. From what I've heard the Serpentis are employing tough marauders to hunt the rogue drones, so your best bet is to focus on them. Return to me once you have the binary code and I will construct a passkey that you can use.<br />
<br />
