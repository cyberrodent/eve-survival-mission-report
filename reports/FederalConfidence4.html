<span id="comment_721"></span>Completed in a &quot;passive&quot; shield tanked Ishtar with active kin/therm hardeners. The Public Confidence Operative drained my cap in a hurry so I couldn't really run the hardeners, but the tank held quite easily even without the hardeners. You'll probably want to take out the nos ship first and keep your distance if you're running an active tank.

<span id="comment_856"></span>Killing the Public Confidence Operative did not trigger any aggro from Group 3. Jamming is done by the two State Oshiro's in Group 3, scrambling by the Taibu State Samurai. My Group 3 were 4x State Zen and 2x State Oshiro (no Tenno).

<span id="comment_1444"></span>Can be easily run even in a dual repper dominix, just primary the NOSing BS and maybe start with one repper only. After that, it's the usual semi-AFK mission running.<br />
<br />
Oh, and I never had my cap drained dry, as JohnBull's Ishtar did.

<span id="comment_1747"></span>Dual hardener Hyperion works well (2x kin, 2x therm)<br />
<br />
The ship that NOS's is the BS in spawn 1 so you want to wait to kill it until you have everything else in group 1 destroyed.  Group 2 will attack drones if they are too close but doesn't draw aggro.  Additional ships will take aggro from Group 2 but doesn't transfer to your main.

<span id="comment_3184"></span>Beware - you can't outrun the NOS BS ... it moves at over 800m/s. Must be packing a MWD. I hadn't fitted one as this is supposed to be deadspace, right? In an actively tanked Megathron, realised this was a nonstarter (had hoped to keep range open - not possible; couldn't crack the NOS BS fast enough with drones and rails, cap failing rapidly) and warped out. <br />
<br />
Will try again tomorrow after reset and sic heavy web drones onto the NOS BS; should be able to keep at range then ...

<span id="comment_3188"></span>Did this in a paladin. The Fed Conf Operative can get in close fast, really screwing your damage up. Maintain transversal if in a gun boat, and take him out.<br />
<br />
Golem'd be better if you have one, due to being able to pop him from range with less problems, and less reliance on active tanking (if you pulse boost)

<span id="comment_3203"></span>Succeeded on second attempt (actively tanked Megathron) - used Beserker EW stasis webbing drones x5 to slow the NOS BS down to around 230m/s then outran him with AB on - and took him out from 35-40km with rails. Cruisers then fell rapidly. Warped out once to replace EW drones with full rack of Ogres, then finished off remaining BS's.

<span id="comment_4729"></span>Easily completed in Vargur using autocannons and phased plasma, easily tracked (and killed) the federation confidence operative before he could do anything bad to my cap. Also with a little convincing all of them died within tractor range.

<br />
You gain 7% (relative) with the Gallente Federation (before Social; I have Social Level 5, so I got 8.75%).  My Transaction Log for Caldari State claimed that I lost -4.8908% to &quot;Derived Modification&quot; and -2.4% to &quot;Combat - Ship Kill&quot;.<br />
<br />
Any fleetmates who help you on-grid will also get a -2.4% for &quot;Combat - Ship Kill&quot;.

<span id="comment_5917"></span>Just ran this mission in a DNI, was ECM'd by 3 of the battleships, not sure which. The Public Confidence Operative neuted and sensor dampened me, I had to call a Vagabond in to beat the ECMing Battleships, Sentry guns and cruise turrets will deaggro and reaggro on Drones, nearly took out a few of my Ogre II's. This mission was a pain in the hind to do, but the loot was:<br />
<br />
Caldari Navy Admiral : 4<br />
Caldari Navy Commodore II : 16<br />
Caldari Navy Vice Admiral : 6<br />
and, Federation Navy Fleet Colonel II : 2

<span id="comment_6277"></span>Ran with a Vargur. Used thermal and kinetic shield hardeners along with a Gist shield booster. The Public Confidence Operative was quickly killed, but the aggro from Group 3 went to one of my sentry drones, which was quickly died. Full aggro of the room required a warp out. Returned with a logistics ship to help out. Again, Group 3 preferred engaging the drones.<br />
<br />
The Group 3 battleships orbit at 50 km and fire Wrath missiles, doing kinetic damage. They seem to do the most DPS.

<div class="comment">
<span id="comment_7899"></span>Completed in Vexor Navy Issue with high (85%+) thermal &amp; kinetic armor resists, active tank. On warp-in fired the MWD and got some distance to separate the NOS BS from the pack. Then turned around and intercepted him, activated NOS on him (4x Medium Diminishing Power System Drain I), which was more than enough to keep the cap stable at his drain rate. Deployed heavy drones and watched him die.<br />
<br />
Switched to sentries afterwards for the remaining rats. Keep watch on your drones; Group 3 aggroed them repeatedly.
