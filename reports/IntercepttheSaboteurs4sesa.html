<span id="comment_1134"></span>Switched things up the last 3 times I did this mission. Can consistently drops from the last 1 or 2 ships killed. This remained true even when I saved cruisers and intys for last. Pretty sure blitzing isn't really an option here (unless finishing with one ship left counts as a blitz).<br />
<br />
As for Cleanup, it seems I warp in at slightly different position each time. This seems to affect chain aggro unless I reposition first (which adds time, so I don't do it). More evidene that this one's unblitzable IMO.

<span id="comment_1314"></span>Discussion from [[AnathemaMatou]]:<br />
<br />
there is a lot of wrong info here. first of all, it's 4 groups: right, middle front, middle back (6 frigates), left group. shooting the right one aggroes the middle-front as well, and apparently the middle-back group can be aggroed standalone (see comments). however the middle-back and right group aggroed my second gang member after the right group was dead and he started to shoot the middle-front group. the can did not drop from the right group, which i finished first. it dropped from the last ship of the middle-front group for me (unfortunately this was the last group standing, so I can't say anything definitive about a blitz).

<div class="comment">
<span id="comment_1980"></span>To further clarify, especially  the blitz.  There are 4 groups, 2 groups of 6 frigates.  The far right and what people are referring to as Group 3 is actually one group, thus when you shoot either one you get all of them.  This is the group that drops the mission item.  You need only aggro the right front group of 6 frigates after warping in, once you kill them shoot anything in the far right group.  Kill the ships coming at you from the right, then start targeting the other ships.  I finished the mission with 14 ships still alive, the rear group of 6 frigates and the far left group.   Well then I killed them just to collect the bounties, but yes you can blitz this mission without killing every ship.

<span id="comment_4288"></span>to test this blitz vs no blitz question, I went in with a proteus (94/96 th/kin resists, 1200 HP repaired every 10s, etc.) I went straight for the transport ships ignoring or droning anything else that got in the way - the transport ships just dropped drugs if you did that. <br />
<br />
so then I went on to target the BS's- nope. <br />

so then I went on to target the brutixy looking ones - nope. <br />

<span id="comment_4825"></span>For me the groups were more or less swapped laterally as well. Also, the far left and the far right were the same and equal to what is described as &quot;far left&quot; above, i.e. 1BS, 2BC, 3EWC, 2D/2F. What is described as the right group was missing. The Right-Center group was split into two separately killable groups equal to the far left / far right groups.<br />

This looks like it needs a little further refinement ...

<span id="comment_4860"></span>Very easy mission, you can snipe scramblling frigs (agent, spy) without agroing other groups. Once they are dead I have started with closest group and kill them one buy one. If you are in BS, you dont have to be carefull and can agroo whole room. I moved back about 20km while fighting closest group, the rest was easily sniped from place. Just dont snipe small low bounty frigs. Drones will take care of them and you can start shooting bigger targets. <br />

I started by aggroing the rightmost group. Other NPCs aggroed and then I killed them one by one using sentries exclusively (Ishtar with Garde IIs, 1 MAR active for the lulz).<br />
Out of all aggroing ships, I kept the Rear Admiral for last. When it died it dropped the can with Viral Agent.<br />
Very easy mission indeed. 14 NPCs left on the battlefield.

I found this mission extremely easy. I recommend this mission to any beginner Battleship pilots that like to kite. Much more bounties than lvl 3 and just as easy. At 40 - 100k I was never touched by them. One sensor dampener from a thorax.

<div class="comment">
<span id="comment_7240"></span>All five (there are five) groups can be aggro'd separately. First, I flew to the right to get proximity aggro from the rightmost group and was able to pull only that group. Then, I flew slightly to the left and pulled the center group with the core admiral and the transports. One of the ships, the last one for me, in this group dropped the mission objective. Loot the can and got the mission complete. This left the group on the far left and two groups of frigates/destroyers in the center. There is one group guarding the outpost, and one on the armory. They can be pulled separately as well. If you have a good tank, it's much quicker to take several groups, or the whole room, at a time, but it can be done this way. Each group can be pulled separately as long as you get aggro without shooting first.

<span id="comment_7396"></span>Since Retribution at least, this is expensive on drones - lots of small ships that will target them even if not aggroed. <br />
<br />
Also, be careful when engaging groups. Some or all aggro based on range. If you need to approach, particularly one of the flank groups, be careful not to get too close to the central groups.

<span id="comment_7573"></span>Done this mission twice this week. First time I had bad problems with drones being targeted. Lost six and withdrew about 15.<br />
<br />
This time my drones didn't get targeted at all. The only difference I can see is that this time I had the drones on Passive whereas last time they were set on aggressive. <br />
<br />
Although on aggressive last time I didn't let them do their own thing. I directed them to targets all the time. This, if it means anything, tends to indicate that merely being on aggressive attracts aggro. Needs more testing and analysis

<span id="comment_7832"></span>Mission is a waste of time as EveMir said.<br />
Done this mission a few times lately. Shooting the left-most group did not aggro whole room. Shooting the right-most group aggroed whole room.

Lost a couple of T2 light drones before I could call them back.. damaged others.<br />
Definatly have your drones on passive and pick your targets carefully.<br />
Bounties = 2.1m<br />
Loot + Salvage + Structures = 3.5m<br />
Waste of time as others have said.
