<span id="comment_3068"></span>Mission 7 - Background Check, all the triggers for me, were completely wrong.<br />
<br />
It seemed more like destroying any class of ship, eg: all the cruisers or battleships from a wave, would cause the next. The only out of place was that you could get frigate spawns at the begining of taking down a set. Only one point did the DPS look dangerous and thats when I had 3 Tyrants and 6 BC, and 4 cruisers in play. Was quickly saved by knocking out the Tryants.  FYI Done in an armor tanked Ishtar.

<span id="comment_5936"></span>Mission 7 triggers are off but you can't go far wrong if you start with eliminating battleships and work down the chain each time.<br />
<br />
I killed all the ships in mission 8 but had to warp out a couple of times due to bad tactics. NO faction loss.<br />
<br />
The 5 x Outpost Defender 'frigates' are not frigates but heavy-hitting fighter drones. Until I realised this I ignored them and couldn't figure out what was destroying my tank (1EM/1therm Gankaddon).<br />
<br />
3 of the battleships (Diviners, I think) were extremely fast moving and covered the 95km distance to my non-AB kiting BS in 20 seconds or so. They were the neuting ships. The remaining 4 battleships I don't know much about; I couldn't figure out their optimal or dmg since I mistook the fighter drones' DPS for theirs. As far as I could tell, though, there was no additional spawn.<br />
<br />
Drop was fairly dismal:<br />
12 x Navy Colonel Insignia I<br />
14 x Navy General Insignia II<br />
7 Armour plates<br />
28 trippeds<br />
Very sparse loot including some misc gear and one 1600mm rolled Tungsten. Not really worth the trouble.

<span id="comment_6617"></span>Completed missions 6 to 10 in T2 fitted Command ship (Sleipnir). Mission 8 completed without killing NPC's. <br />
<br />
Mission 11 - Ascending Nobles<br />
DPS was bit much so I used Battleship.<br />
<br />
After that decided to upgrade Command Ship (Sleipnir) to Faction/Deadspace fit up. No problem after that.

The extra spawn is not dependent upon looting Mina Darabi from the container. It will spawn anyway (I'm assuming because 30 minutes elapsed since I completed the mish) <br />

(found this out the hard way of going the six jumps back to get the noctis and warping in again)

I have had great difficulty with this mission today (August 2015). Rahsa's Security Card would not drop, and I could not activate the gate by blowing up the Battletower. I submitted a ticket, and the GMs kindly reset it, but unfortunately this did not fix the issue. Just make sure you submit a support ticket if you encounter the same issue.
