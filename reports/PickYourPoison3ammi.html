<br />
Faction: optional Minmatar or Amarr, depending on your choices in Pocket 1.<br />
Hull restriction: Cruiser size or smaller.<br />
No faction standings losses are incurred for completing this mission for either full clear or blitz.<br />
<br />
There are 2 parts to this mission, the first part is in the first pocket and restricts the size of ship that can be used to a cruiser or smaller, but there are no hostiles. You need only grab the cargo using a MWD frig or shuttle. Once you have the diplomat in cargo, you must warp back to the entrance and deposit it in a can. This can be accomplished in the fast ship, but if desired this part may be completed in any combat ship as no gate is required. This allows you to engage the navy ships present.<br />
<br />
<h4>Warp-in</h4>

Initially at the warp-in there is an acceleration gate and a stationary SOE Rescue Vessel. There are no hostiles.<br />
<br />
<h3>Pocket 1</h3>

<br />
Pocket One consists of no hostiles two cans: one labeled Minmatar Embassy Housing, one labeled Amarr Embassy Housing and an Acceleration Gate to Pocket 2.  Shortly after warping in you are given a message that you can only save one.<br />
<br />
Pick up the embassy staff from one of the housing cans, and the other blows up. Contrary to the mission advice, you do not seem to lose faction standing for the faction that you leave behind, or receive any improvements if you rescue one or both.<br />
<br />
Note: It is possible to rescue both diplomats at once, but it will require a fleet and proper timing. Once you rescue one, you will have only a few seconds to rescue the second before the embassy building explodes, so you'll need a second pilot at the other embassy to grab the other diplomat at the same time you do. Either way, an opposing fleet will be present at the destination of the second gate (ie, the mission entrance) following your rescue. A third pilot with a well-tanked battleship can withstand the enemy fleet while other pilots complete the drop-off.<br />
<br />
There is an acceleration gate here that returns to the warp-in/mission entrance and it will place you at 50km from the container, but if you prefer it is possible to warp out and then warp back to the mission.<br />
<br />
<h3>Second Gate (Mission Entrance)</h3>

<br />
In addition to the SOE Rescue Vessel present when you first warped-in, you now have faction ships of the faction you didn't save out for your blood (See list below), but you do not have to kill them to complete the mission. Ships will vary depending on which empire space you are in.<br />
<br />
Example Amarr spawn:<br />
3x Frigate (Imperial Felix)<br />
4x Cruiser (Imperial Templar Agatho)<br />
2x Battleship (Imperial Tanakh)<br />
<br />
Example Minmatar spawn:<br />
4x Frigate (Republic Baldur/Takan)<br />
3x Cruiser (Republic Tribal Ormur/Rodul)<br />
2x Battleship (Republic Jotun/Sigur)<br />
<br />
There is no reason to take the gate as it will simply return you to P1. The mission is complete once the diplomatic staff are placed inside the <a class="missingpage" href="./SoE.html/edit" title="Create this page">SoE</a> ship.<br />
<br />
<h5>Method</h5>

<span class="notes">'Blitz</span>':Use a fast frigate or interceptor. Pick up the diplomat in P1. Return to the warp in, drop them off, and warp away. Mission is complete.<br />
<br />
<span class="notes">'Eliminating the Navy Ships</span>': Instead of returning to the entrance start point immediately, you can go get your ship of choice to kill all enemies at the warp-in point.  Simply ensure you transfer<br />
the rescued diplomat into your combat ship's cargohold.  Upon returning to the warp-in/mission entrance you can kill everything with your large ship and deposit the diplomat.<br />
<br />
<h5>Isk</h5>

<h4>Amarr</h4>

Bounty: <br />
Loot: ~ <strong>7.7M Isk</strong> in Insignias and other drops<br />
<br />
<h4>Minmatar</h4>

Unknown (Minmatar?) loot = approx 11.9 Mil ISK if you salvage everything<br />
<br />
Minimatar Loot + Salvage <br />
12.6 M Jita Buy. <br />
<h5>Standing</h5>

No standing loss from killing ships in pocket 2.<br />

<span id="comment_5635"></span>P.S. Twiddling with the overview will result in your shuttle getting shot, and the cargo might be lost(at least in my case), which means you'll have to fail the mission. So, get your overview right before plunging in:-)

<span id="comment_5771"></span>Did this mission in a Vexor. Choose to rescue Amarr as offence and defence where better suited to fight Minmatar. After getting the Amarrian diplomat I decided to warp to the nearest station to drop off the guy in case things went sour.<br />
Returned to the room only to be welcomed by the Minmatar gatecamping and expressing their heart feelings by shooting at me right away. Hit the gas and activated the AB. Then after deploying the drones I started taking them down, small to big. Frigates killed by drones, biggies bu guns and later drones. The first BS took ages (active shield tank). The second ran faster then I could follow so I warped out again and collected the diplomat, feeling more confident now.<br />
Even though being more than 200km away at warp out, at warp in the BS was gatecamping again. so repeating gas, AB, drones deployed, running towards the SOE can. Dropped the diplomat on the fly and kept on going. After reloading I went for a smoke (afk), on return BS was gone. Drones where Hammerhead I, could not have done the BS wihthout them. (sorry cant post fitting, dont know how to copy.)

<span id="comment_5808"></span>Ship restrictions only apply to the gate.  I took a Rifter went in and got the diplomat then went back and got my BC.  Heading to the SoE ship as I type this.  Possible blitz.  Makes it easier by far rather than trying to do it in a T1 cruiser.

<div class="comment">
<span id="comment_5819"></span>Tried the shuttle blitz, didn't quite make it. I tried bookmarking the SoE can and starting but cancelling the use of the gate from pocket 2 back to 1, but it wouldn't allow that. Taking the gate dropped me 50km from the can, with the Minmatar between me and the can. Took damage all the way to the can, and was dragging the ambassador when I blew up. Perhaps if I'd set the ship to fly by rather than stopping I'd have made it. Anyway, the ambassador was in the shuttle wreck, so I came back in a T2-tanked drake (exp + invul active hardeners), flew over and completed the transfer. Shields were at 79% on warp out, and since I didn't shoot anything I took no standing loss. Also didn't get any gain with Amarr.

<span id="comment_6174"></span>I've ran this mission several times in a Wolf (Minmatar Assault Class Frigate) fitted with a T2 1MN MWD and T2 Overdrive Injector System. Once you pick up the diplomat of choice, you can warp back to Pocket 1, and &quot;Run&quot; for the Sisters ship. The only real problem is slowin' down at the Sisters ship to drop off the diplomat, but if you're quick enough, you can succeed. I haven't lost My Wolf yet.

<div class="comment">
<span id="comment_7530"></span>Completing in Myrm is easy (obviously).  A few notes from repeated trials:<br />
<br />
1.  Drones:  Faction ships in first pocket DO aggro heavies, DON'T aggro mediums and below.  <br />
This leads to an interesting phenomenon, whereby I can release ogres while burning AB, then recall ogres after they draw target.  Faction ships don't retarget me if I stay distant, not even after killing some of them.  I find they do retarget if I approach within 30km, so aggro may actually be proximity based.  That behavior means that a single released heavy will allow any ship to AB out of danger and complete the mission.<br />
<br />
2.  Tags:  It's been mentioned that tags drop and that faction kills don't hurt standings.  These should really be said in the same sentence, because it's a rare opportunity to collect tags without consequence.  Also note most valuable tags (Majors) are always on cruisers and sell for 1m+ each.

Go back to your station and switch to larger ship and return to warp-in point. Kill everything with larger ship, deposit Ambassador and salvage.&quot;<br />
<br />
In a Myri. Very easy. BS's and other ships do very little damage even when on top of you. Remember to drop a bookmark on your first time at the gate so you can jump back at distance with the bigger ship (Although I jumped right on top of them and they didn't hurt)<br />
