<h3>About The Low Sec Missions</h3>

All missions in this series can be accepted and completed remotely ( Unknown if last mission can be completed away from agent location ), the reward item will be placed into your cargo, make sure to leave some room.<br />
If the Agent window to complete does not appear, right click and start conversation with the agent in the journal window.<br />
Systems names purposely left out of guide. Unknown if they are always the same but all but the last will be low sec.<br />
Missions do not occur in dead space and any room can be warped to in all missions.<br />
No Faction / Corp status losses recorded, gains to True Power.<br />
<br />
<h3>What To Bring & How To Fit It.</h3>

Missions can be done in small cost effective ships, well fitted frigate would do the all of these with the exception of the last mission, which has higher DPS & nos/neut, disruptors, an scramblers.<br />
To easily do them all a Cruiser or Assault Frigate is suggested.<br />
You will also need a codebreak and the hacking skill ( I had hacking 4 & it took about 30 cycles for it to open the container ).<br />
Its suggested you fit a cloak as there is PVP activity in the area and you can expect to be camped in to a system for some period of time.<br />
<br />

<h5>Tips</h5>

<ul><li> Instead of attacking the safe house, attack the power generator behind it.
</li><li> Safe house also drops a container at its center, the structure has a 22km radius so you will need to turn in the mission to retrieve this.
</li><li> Wait till you are out of low sec to start a conversation with him to receive the Sansha "modified" Gnome implant which is placed in to your cargohold.</li></ul>

<span id="comment_3912"></span>On Mission 18 - Regal Replacement:<br />
I had 4 Elite Frigates in the initial spawn in room 2.<br />
<br />
An Addition on the Room 3 spawns:<br />
They seemed to be random/time based, if anything with the 3 elite cruisers being triggered by killing the initial spawn.<br />
The nos/neut from the Imperial Tamir/Templar Muzakir wasn't very noticeable in my Retribution, but I did turn off my afterburner in case.<br />
I should add that Lord Miyan has a heavy nos/neut, neuting approx 250 cap every 10s or so, but it only has a maximum range of 10km. <br />
<br />
On a final note, the mission locations appears to be random. I had Mission 17 - A Digital Soul in highsec while Mission 18 - Regal Replacement was in lowsec.

<span id="comment_4234"></span>Conferming that you can complete remotely and recive the implant.<br />
I did the enitre mission chain in a Pilgrim class recon cruiser, 3 T2 425MM autocannons, cloak, 2 codebreakers, 1 rep, EM/Them hardeners + EANM, easily tanked, and using T2 drones easily chewed up the NPCs.<br />
Also, I was on top of the safehouse in the last mission when it poped, it bounced my pilgrim over 50 kilometers from where I was before the explosion.

<span id="comment_5104"></span>I did the series in a MWD Purifier, basically burning out to 45 on warp in and nuking everything from afar. Worked like a charm since it allowed me to ignore TD/Neuts and the rare Locals, even though the only tank was an MSE2.<br />
<br />
The only speed bumps were the Cruise Missiles Batteries in the first pocket of the last mission and the final Pocket. Those silly interceptors got lucky and put a point and 2 webs on me instantly. Due to Mians cruiser at point blank, burning out of the point/webs with the mwd was no real option. My little ugly snail popped with the pointing NPC in structure...<br />
<br />
Came back in a Zealot I had on standby and took revenge. The total dps of the pocket 3 spawn is rather impressive, as are the hitpoints of that silly safehouse.<br />
The last room should be tricky for most frigate sized hulls.<br />
<br />
I would recommend to do the arc till the last pocket in a SB and change to a cruiser sized hull.<br />
Mission can be completed and advanced remotely. The number of jumps are is sensible <br />
<br />
The missions gave each 5.7ish % standing to True Power.<br />
The arc completion gave 12% standing to the Sansha Nation.

<div class="comment">
<span id="comment_6278"></span>This part of the Arc was surprisingly simple. You can be in and out of the missions in a few minutes except the last one, and as others have pointed out the only problem is the 8 cruise missile batteries. Destroying the Power Generator pops the safehouse as well so don't bother trying to pop the safehouse directly.<br />
<br />
I canibalised a PvP-rigged Pilgrim I had in the area to do this, swapped out the PvP buffer tank for an active hardener and a little buffer -<br />
<br />
HIGH: 3 x 425mm AC II, Cov Cloak<br />
MID: 2 x Cap Recharger, 2 x Codeberaker, 1 x MWD<br />
LOW: 1 x EANM, 1 x EM membrane, 1 x TH membrane, 800mm plate, Medium rep.<br />
RIGS:  2 x Trimark<br />
<br />
DRONES: 5 x Hammerhead II, 5 x Hobgoblin II, 5 x Acolyte II, 5 x VESPA EC-600 (just in case :D)<br />
<br />
No issues with tank breaking at any point. The area was pretty dead when I went through it at peak time too, which was surprising. All the missions spawned in lo-sec, nothing in hi-sec at all for me.
