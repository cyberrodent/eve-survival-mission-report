<br />
<h4>Single Pocket (2 Groups)</h4>
 
<br />
<h5>Broadcast Tower Group (44km)</h5>

(Mixed Fleet with 3 time based reinforcement spawns every 2 minutes) Complete Fleet after spawns :<br />
8x Frigate (Federation Praktor Belos, Praktor Harpago)<br />
7x Elite Frigate (Elite Federation Machina, Pelekus, Phalarica, Arcus)<br />
5x Destroyer (Federation Arcus, Pelekus)<br />
10x Cruiser (Federation Praktor Centurion, Praktor Legionarius)<br />
9x Elite Cruiser (Elite Federation Arx, Auxilia, Liburna, Calo, Quadrieris)    <br />
5x Battlecruiser (Federation Praktor Bearcus, Federation Calo)<br />
13x Battleship (Federation Covinus, Federation Praktor Phanix, Praktor Praeses, Praktor Polemo, Praktor Hexeris, Praktor Magister)<br />
<br />
<div class="indent">Tip : Time based spawns happen quickly. All ships will drop Gallente Navy Tags but be forewarned, negative standing hits incured for Aggro / Ship Kill. Expect EWAR from Elite Frigates and Elite Cruisers. Probably a good idea to get help from friends before attacking this group :)</div>
<br />
<h5>Federation Navy Shipyard Group (63km)</h5>

1x Elite Frigate (Elite Federation Manica) <em><strong>Warp Scram</strong></em><br />
2x Elite Frigate (Elite Federation Matara) <em><strong>Sensor Dampening</strong></em><br />
5x Elite Destroyer (Elite Federation Arcus)<br />

</li><li> Can MUST be hacked AND looted in order to complete mission. Buying from the market won't do it.
</li><li> No need to kill the Broadcast Tower.</li></ul>
<br />
<div class="indent">Tip #2 :  <strong>Use a Tengu with a Mobile Depot</strong> and refit for a Emergent Locus Analyzer subsystem + data analyzer I/II on site so you don't have to re-ship. Lvl 5 on the Electronics subsystem skill of chosen will give you good hacking HP/damage to beat the mini-game.</div>

<h3><span class="underline">Mission 10</span> - The Breakout</h3>

<br />
Faction: Gallente Navy<br />
Space type: Deadspace<br />
Damage dealt: Therm/Kin<br />
Web/Scramble: N/A<br />
Recommended damage dealing: Therm (best), Kin (secondary)<br />
Items Needed: Probe Launcher & Core Probes (Scanning), Data Analyzer (Hacking), FOF <a class="" href="./FedNav.html">FedNav</a> Identifier Tag (Gained from Agent). <em>&lt;Items not needed if you buy the mission item off the market/contracts&gt;</em><br />
<br />
Note - Mission site (Federation Detention Facility) is a Cosmic Signature (Combat Site) which must be probed to 100% first before warping to it. The site will spawn in each system within the Constellation when mission is accepted and will respawn if someone else completes it.<br />
<br />
<strong>Blitz :</strong> Buy the Caldari Navy prisioner on Contracts or market and complete the mission. No need to search/probe, hack, or fight anything.<br />
<br />
Mission Site = Two Pockets<br />
<br />
<h4>First Pocket</h4>

1x Newly Constructed Acceleration Gate (95km)<br />
<br />
No NPC's most of the time<br />
<br />
Sometimes it ends up with:<br />
<h5>Group 1:</h5>

6x Frigate (Federation Praktor Phalarica/Machina/Harpgo)<br />
2x Destroyer (Federation Belos)<br />
3x Elite Frigate (Elite Federation Lochos/Libertus)<strong>Scram</strong><br />
<br />
<h5>Group 2:</h5>

6x Elite Frigates (Elite Federation Phalarica/Machina)<br />
3x Elite Cruiser (Elite Fedeartion Arx)<strong>damping</strong><br />
<br />
<h5>Group 3:</h5>

7x Battleships (Federation Praktor Magister/Navis Praetoria/Polemo/Hexeris)<strong>Navis damps</strong><br />
<br />
<div class="indent">In the case of these spawns, a cloaky is best used to just fly past them to the gate. The tag does not prevent them from attacking.</div>
<br />
<br />
<h4>Second Pocket</h4>

<br />
<h5>Initial Group (25km)</h5>

8x Gallente Warden Frigate (Federation Clavis, Hastile)<br />
<br />
Structures (Hack with Data Analyzer) :<br />
8x Federation Dention Facility - each contains 1x Caldari Prisoner Of War (Mission Objective)<br />
<br />
Note - The Gallente Warden Frigates will not attack if the FOF <a class="" href="./FedNav.html">FedNav</a> Identifier Tag (Gained from Agent) is in your cargohold (There is a bug where they will still shoot you but they hit for 1 damage). After successfully hacking a Detention Facility to save a prisoner, a short self-destruct timer will start. You may be able to hack another one before the Detention Facility self-destructs but only 1x Caldari Prisoner Of War is needed to complete the mission.<br />
<br />
The Detention Facility structures will have a white container to Hack. If no Detention Facility structures are present or you see 8x blue containers, then that site has been completed by another player. Instead of waiting for respawn, just look for the site in another system.<br />
<br />
<hr />

<h3><span class="underline">Mission 11</span> - Whisper of a Conspiracy</h3>

<br />
Sinas sends you to a low sec system in Black Rise where he wants you to check out an Ishkone facility and see if they are exchanging prisoners of war with the Gallente. <br />
<br />
Route can be either entirely high sec or go into low-sec so be careful. Warp to the mish site. Sinas says to check out the telescope. Once you reach about 10km from it, Sinas hacks it for you and you can open it to get the mish item, an Encrypted Data Node. <br />
<br />
<div class="indent">Tip: Same drill as before. Nano Interceptor/fast frigate/cloaky frigate and beware of gate camps.</div>
 <br />
<hr />

<h3><span class="underline">Mission 12</span> - Practical Solutions</h3>

<br />
Mission Type: Courier<br />
<br />
Pick up Vira Mikano from an Ishkone Watch station and bring him back to Sinas so he can decrypt the Encrypted Data Node.<br />
<strong></strong><br />
<hr />

<h3><span class="underline">Mission 13</span> - Forewarning</h3>

<br />
Mission Type: Courier to Deadspace Location (Low Sec)<br />
Recommended Ship: Very fast frigate, interceptor or covert ops<br />
<br />
<div class="indent">Tip: Same drill. Nanofit and 2x <a class="missingpage" href="./WarpCoreStabelizer.html/edit" title="Create this page">WarpCoreStabelizer</a> if possible. Watch out for gatecamps and pirates.</div>
<br />
Mission ends when you make the drop into the Conference Center. <br />

<br />
For me there were plenty of elite frigs and also some elite cruisers: one group with only elite frigates at the Shipyard, but I got aggro from the (two) mixed groups at some point as well. Ishkur probably can do it, but I'm sure an Ishtar does much better! Removing the mixed group also gave me one respawn some time later of another mixed group, and when salvaging near the Broadcast tower another one! Furthermore a third respawn including 3 Navy Dominixes! Followed by a fourth respawn... You will lose standing for killing ships from these groups too! I counted at least 13 BS rats when I hacked the can finally (they did not aggro me).

<span id="comment_3832"></span>The Breakout:<br />
It seems that Hacking at level 1 is not high enough to access the Federation Detention Facility. I have a message telling me that the facility is too complex... and the codebreaker won't auto-repeat. I still have the tag, I will try at Hacking L2 or L3 if it's not enough...<br />
<br />
By the way, when scanning for the Facility, it will appear as a cosmic signature. You have to scan it down to 100% to be able to bookmark it. I had to use a Magnate and sister's launcher and probes, cause my skills at scanning are not very high.

<span id="comment_3876"></span>I ran the breakout today and found the detention center in 3 different systems all existing at once. Apparently CCP made it easier, so whatever system you start scanning in will have the center in it. The tag was not consumed when I went through the gate either. I was able to complete the mission in a covops with a mwd. The first room has a ton of rats but with the mwd I went too fast to take any damage. Second room never aggroed me either.

<span id="comment_4533"></span>Caldari Penumbra - The Price of Silence:<br />
Easily soloable in Tengu with 2x Sensor Backup Array II in lows. Got jammed twice during whole mission. Both stasis towers are extremely weak and practically insta-poppable, would advise to take them out first. With Tengu's tiny signature, torpedoes deal 5-10 damage, rest is also relatively harmless.<br />
<br />
If you worry about you own DPS, take down the rooks/buzzards first, then redock and swap Sensor Arrays for damage mods. I didn't bother, but could probably save a few minutes in the long run.

Just kill the small group. The main group will not aggro. You can then hack the container without interference.

<br />
after I had to warp out several times due to the Sensor Dampening stuff, I used FoF Cruise Missiles. After I arrived at the location and fired my first missiles I noticed that NONE of the ships even bothered to target or shoot me. They just sat there and got shot... could finish the mission quite easy.

<span id="comment_6792"></span>Caldari Epic Arc completed in Tech 3 Cruiser (Loki) rigged and Faction fitted active shield tank. I decided to just post my log records since the missions are numbered differently.<br />
<br />
Chapter 2 - Blackness Rising<br />
<br />
Mission 14 - Meet Sinas<br />
Report to agent in high sec system<br />
<br />
Mission 15 - Right Tool For The Job<br />
No blitz for this mission. Can't access the can/shipyard while NPC's are in area. Mission requirement is destroy Communications Array, destroy all hostile forces, hack into shipyard and collect mission objective (FedNav Tag). There's only 1 Manica NPC and it does do warp scram. Destroying the Communication Array first probably delays or stops the reinforcement spawns.<br />
<br />
Initial Group:<br />
4x Federation Praktor Cruiser (Centurion, Legionarius)<br />
12x Elite Federation Frigate (Arcus, Phalarica, Matara, Machina, Manica)  <br />
<br />
All wrecks drop Gallente Federation Tags. I received two different negative Faction standing hits for ship kill:<br />
<br />
1x -2.4%<br />
1x -0.018%<br />
<br />
Mission 16 - The Breakout<br />
No NPC's in 1st pocket. No aggro from 8 Gallente NPC Frigate's in 2nd pocket. No need to destroy them for mission completion. Accessed cans from exploded Prison structures after completing mission due to large amount of Prisoners and Janitors dropped.<br />
<br />
Mission 17 - Whisper Of A Conspiracy (low sec)<br />
Courier mission, pick up item and return to agent.<br />
<br />
Mission 18 - Practical Solutions<br />
Courier mission, pick up item and return to agent.<br />
<br />
Mission 19 - Forewarning (low sec)<br />
Courier mission, drop off item and return to agent.<br />
<br />
Chapter 3 - The Bottom Line<br />
<br />
Mission 20 - The Knowledge To Act<br />
2 different branch options:<br />
Home In Peace - Courier mission, pick up item in low sec. - Nugoehuvi path<br />
Slipping Away - Report to Agent in high sec. - Hyasyoda path<br />
<br />
Mission 21 - Slipping Away<br />
Report to Agent in high sec system.<br />
<br />
Mission 22 - Across The Line<br />
The perma jamming in this mission is unbalanced. Even with T2 ECCM and Sensor back-up modules fitted for 49 points of sensor strength, still couldn't break the jamming. Had to refit Loki as missile boat and use Faction FoF missiles.<br />
<br />
FoF missiles will auto target the closest NPC within range so keep watch on your target NPC range.<br />
<br />
After trigger spawn, when warping out and back, Caretaker will always aggro first and approach very quickly, basically taking all the FoF missile aggro. NPC group will advance out and back from spawn point twice. Caretaker will stay out at boundry limit.<br />
<br />
I made bookmarks and warped to them within the mission site. Lead Caretaker to one side, then warp to other side to work on Frigs and Cruisers. Cruisers are very tough.<br />
<br />
To quickly complete mission, just have a friend fleet up and take out the Frigs and Cruisers. No standing hit for ship kill.<br />
<br />
Check your Faction standing and file petition if no increase is gained.

<span id="comment_7150"></span>Just finished this arc, and confirming the perma-jam in &quot;Across the Line&quot;.<br />
<br />
Even in a Tengu with all skills level V and an ECCM *overloaded* (78 points of sensor strength) it isn't enough to interrupt the continuous jamming from the Cruisers.<br />
<br />
Auto-Targeting missiles for the win... or, any other weapon that doesn't require lock to kill the targets.<br />
<br />
Note that I did not get webbed or scrammed by any of the frigates.  Overall, an easy mission if you're prepared for it.
