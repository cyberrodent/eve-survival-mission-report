<br />
<h4>Warp In</h4>

<br />
There are 5 Pods when you warp in, one of them is not damaged (Show info on each pod to find the one with the description not including "This escape pod has been damaged..."). Approaching this undamaged pod will pop up a message and spawn a container. Loot the passenger Oura Madusaari; this passenger is needed to unlock the acceleration gate. Oura Madusaari remains in cargo (October 19th 2011).<br />
<br />
Approaching the other four "damaged" pods will pop up a message and the pod contains a Stranded Pilot (not needed to complete the mission).<br />
<br />
Looting the highest pod vertically will spawn a separate can that contains Oura Madusaari.<br />
<br />
<strong>Oura Madusaari functions like a gate key and doesn't despawn. Keep one of her in cargo and you can skip the life pods and go straight through the gate.</strong><br />
<br />
<h4>Pocket 1</h4>

<br />
<br />
You will encounter periodic damage from the anomaly from about 5000m, 5 hits around 200 - 400, Initially there are 4 Debris Silos(a popup message appears after destroying each of them, You will get damage upon destruction of each silo, 5 hits around 300 - 500), destroy the silo closest to the Anomaly (7 o'clock). Its destruction causes the wreck of the "Paryi" to appear. Approach the wreck and a pop up will appear along with a container from which the mission objective (Dr. Fajah Ateshi) must be looted.<br />
<img src="http://i.imgur.com/G7MtI.jpg" alt="the marked one" title="this one drops Ateshi" /><br />
The Debris Silos drop T1 ammo.<br />
<br />
Using 'Combat' drones in order to kill the silo can kill them even before the silo is destroyed (as of 19 October 2011). 'using sentry drones will take damage but wont break there shields.'<br />
<br />
<strong>1) You must go to the pod that says "A life pod from a long since destroyed ship" in its Show Info. <br />
2) Get Oura Madusari from the cargo container that spawns.<br />
3) Use gate to next room and destroy the silo, that is located at 7'clock closest to the anomaly. Get the doctor and get out :)</strong><br />

<em>I'm naked and I'm walking the blue-painted halls at military academy, and it's okay because everyone gets hazed like this and I'm in better shape than all of them so I'm not ashamed, except this means they can see the scars twining from my back and down to my knees like snakes, and what starts as laughter turns into confused whispering and sounds of pity as they realize how recently I was a slave, and I want to kill them slowly just like I did the man who gave me the scars, but I just walk on, seeing only red.<br />
<br />
He promised we would go to the beach on my birthday, so we went, even though it was raining, even though we didn't know where mom was again. I was collecting shells, and I found one that was perfect and round and smooth but then I looked back to the shore and saw him just standing there, the first time I'd ever seen him cry, and I wanted to say something but couldn't, just stood there, frozen, the shell crunching in my fist, and I looked down and my hand was bleeding but I didn't feel it at all.<br />
<br />
They called me to identify the body, and I told them she divorced me last year but they didn't care because she had no friends, no family on the planet at all. I went in and they pulled back the sheet and she was there beautiful like she was asleep, and my full name was carved delicately into her left arm like calligraphy, the blood dried like rust on parchment. Every time I closed my eyes for a full year after I saw that. I still miss her. </em><br />

<h2> Part 2 of 3 </h2>

<br />
Faction: None<br />
Mission type: Encounter<br />
Space type: Deadspace<br />
Damage dealt: EM<br />
Recommended damage dealing: None needed<br />
Recommended ship classes: Battleship, Command Ship, Battlecruiser, HAC<br />
<span class="underline">Note: Fitting a microwarpdrive (or at least an afterburner) is highly recommended.</span><br />
<br />
Warp to the Anomaly, use the (now unlocked) acceleration gate.<br />
When approaching the Anomaly (30km from warp in point) it will spawn an Amarr Cruise missile battery. There is no need to destroy the sentry, as when you approach the anomaly, a message appears and it ceases firing. Place the "Neurowave Pattern Scanner" you received from your agent in the Anomaly to complete the mission.<br />
<br />
Silos drop Ammo.<br />
<br />

<h2> Part 3 of 3 </h2>

<br />
Faction: Rogue drones<br />
Mission type: Encounter<br />
Space type: Deadspace<br />
Damage dealt: All kinds ( Standard Rogue Drone: More Exp/Kin less EM/Therm )<br />
Recommended damage dealing: EM<br />
Recommended ship classes: Battleship, Command Ship, Battlecruiser, HAC, Navy Apoc works<br />
<br />
Drones will aggro other groups, but not spawn groups.<br />
Attacking any ship in Pocket 2 will aggro the entire pocket; however, spawned reinforcements remain passive unless attacked.<br />
Attacking a passive reinforcement will also aggro all other passive ships.<br />
<br />
<h4>Pocket 1</h4>

As you warp in there are 4 groups of Rogue Drones.<br />
<br />
<h5>Group 1 ( Auto-Aggro)</h5>

2x Battleship (Patriach Alvus/Alvus Creator/Ruler)<br />
<br />
<h5>Group 2</h5>

3x Cruiser (Viral Infector/Devastator/Violator Alvum)<br />
2x Battelcruiser (Crippler/Striker Alvatis)<br />
<br />
<h5>Group 3</h5>

1x Elite Frigate(Strain Render Alvi) <strong>(Web/Scram)</strong><br />
3x Frigate (Barracuda/Devilfish/Hunter/Silverfish Alvi)<br />
2x Cruiser (Viral Infector/Devastator Alvum)<br />
<br />
<h5>Group 4</h5>

3x Battleship (Domination/Matriarch/Spearhead Alvus)<br />
<br />
Last kill in each group triggers a respawn:<br />
<br />
<h5>Group 1 Spawn:</h5>

2x Frigate (Hunter/Raider Alvi)<br />
2x Battleship (Swarm Preserver Alvus)<br />
<br />
<h5>Group 2 Spawn:</h5>

2x Frigate (Devilfish Alvi)<br />
2x Battleship (Alvus Controller/Spearhead Alvus)<br />
<br />
<h5>Group 3 Spawn:</h5>

3x Frigate (Decimator Alvi)<br />
2x Cruiser (Bomber Alvum)<br />
1x Battlecruiser (Crippler/Defeater Alvatis)<br />
<br />
Note regarding the acceleration gate: Initially it is not an actual acceleration gate but a "Large Collidable Object" looking like one; it will also not show on the overview. Only after the destruction of the two BCs from Group 2 will the fake gate be changed into a proper acceleration gate that leads to Pocket 2.<br />
<br />
<strong>Blitz: Destroy the two BCs (Crippler/Striker Alvatis) in group 2 to "spawn" the acceleration gate. The gate is not locked, but warp scrambling frigates will prevent you from using it.</strong><br />
<br />
<br />
<h4>Pocket 2</h4>

<h5>Initial Spawn</h5>

1x Elite Frigate (Strain Render Alvi) <strong>Web & Scram</strong><br />
3x Frigate (Hunter/Sunder Alvi) <strong>Trigger Sunder</strong><br />
1x Battlecruiser (Striker Alvatis)<br />
<br />
Attacking and killing the scrambling frigate(s) did not cause the additional spawn. Attacking one of the Sunder Alvi did however.<br />
If you can oneshot the frigs the second spawn WILL NOT appear.  Make sure you get 2 shots off on them.<br />
<br />
<h5>Spawn</h5>

2x Frigate (Decimator/Render Alvi)<br />
2-3x Cruiser (Disintegrator/Violator Alvum)<br />
1-2x Battlecruiser (Defeater/Enforcer/Striker Alvatis)<br />
4x Battleship (Swarm Preserver/Domination/Spearhead Alvus/Supreme Alvus Preserver/Alvus Ruler)<br />
<br />
These seem to be two separate groups and they can aggro drones.<br />
<br />
<strong>Blitz: Use an afterburner to make your way to the rogue drone ship and drop Fajah Ateshi into the can which completes the mission, no drones have to be killed.</strong><br />
<br />
The Anomaly is 30-50 km away from the warp-in. Dropping Fajah Ateshi inside the "Rogue Drone" ship next to it completes the mission and leads to the destruction of the (Orca-Class) "Anomaly" a few seconds later. Alternatively you may put Fajah Ateshi inside "Anomaly", it will disapear (jump out probably) and mission will be completed with trying to save the crew.<br />
<br />
Bounty totaled 8.85m (I got 9+ mil); loot was eliminated effective with Escalation [April 2012].  Salvage was maybe worth 750k [almost not worth doing]. (1.54 mil est price for me) <br />

<span id="comment_5560"></span>1/3: This mission gives you a lot of LP and a good reward for blowing up a silo. The correct silo the one in the back on the left side.<br />
<br />
3/3: The gate to the second pocket only appears after you get a message from Fajah; this message seemed to be triggered by killing a certain ship.<br />
I didn't get the spawn in pocket 2 despite killing the initial group.<br />
<br />
On all missions: the anomaly deals some damage which does not appear in the combat log.

<span id="comment_5579"></span>When you add the dude to the anomaly, the anomaly collapse into something that drains your cap pretty hard. And you most likely need to fly out of it first to warp, since it keeps bumping you.

<span id="comment_5676"></span>3/3 Done in Rattlesnake + Basilisk combo today.<br />
<br />
Confirmed dropping fajah into Anomaly transforms it from a wormhole-like visual to a bright blue gas-cloud visual. The anomaly did not seem to drop my cap or do any damage even though my Basilisk had already left to get his noctis. It did however prevent me from warping out until i got about 20km from the object.<br />
<br />
The supposed 'delayed-spawn' spawned immediately for me. The only thing i think may have triggered it was targeting and killing the Supreme Alvus Preserver first.

In 3/3 both pockets had a Strain Render Alvi scram/webbing. Group 2 had different names but unlocked the gate. All done easily in a T2 fit Drake. Use a MWD if possible.

<br />
Spawn 1 in Pocket 1 appears either when killing the first BS or when shooting at it, 'cause I had the second BS of Group 1 alive, and the other 3 BS from spawn where there.<br />
<br />
In pocket 2, you can't simply fly to the anomaly, group 1 has auto aggro. There are 2 different spawns here aswell with independent aggro.<br />
<br />
Also, this series of missions make a clear reference to the excellent film: Event Horizon

<span id="comment_7194"></span>String of missions is not terrible difficult... in fact, pretty easy. But, very time consuming. L&amp;S is not really worth it. On 3/3 total mission loot plus Salvage is approx 2MIL isk...

<span id="comment_7310"></span>In part 3, pocket 1, there were two Strain Infestor Alvi in group 3. This was in addition to the 4 normal frigates (I think). One of them warp disrupted me and one of them webbed me.

'gate key' (Oura Madusari) is not consumed when using gate. also, if you have &quot;type&quot; column on your overview the correct life pod is easily identified, but i grabbed the 4 other &quot;stranded pilots&quot; just for good measure. (dropped a 100mn mwd in the raven. 20-30km distance between pods). tanked for EM in the pocket, damage was minimal (in a raven) &quot;buildings&quot; dropped a variety of t1 ammo.<br />
<br />
part 2<br />
<br />
confirming exactly as described. tank for the damage (EM), fly 30km (ignore missle battery, it does turn off. do note however that I received a 55k bounty for shooting it ! ), place cargo, leave. <br />
<br />
part 3<br />
pocket 1 full clear<br />
t2 fit raven omni tank using t1 mjolnir cruise missile (200+km range). landed (initial groups are 30-50km from warp-in), turned around and immediately MJD 100km away. killed off initial ships on a first come first served basis. then aggroed the spawns. and again closest ship loses. shields never dropped below 95%. nothing even made it to my drone range(57km). no loot, 1.2m salvage, 5.6m bounties. <br />
pocket 2<br />
initial ships at 10-20km did same as above. results same as above. another 700k salvage, 3.3m bounties. battleships hit very hard if they get into range. the last couple of BS actually made it into drone range and until then my shields sat at 99%. dropped to around 75% until I popped one of them.

&quot;You have failed your family,&quot; he tells me with gentleness I know he's incapable of feeling. &quot;You have dishonored us. You know what to do.&quot; And I know that the honorable thing is to fall on my sword like a good girl, so I take it out and push it through his chest and show him exactly what I think of his precious honor. I will never have to apologize again.
