Faction:  Gallente Federation<br />
Mission Type:  Encounter (Normal)<br />
Damage Dealt:  Therm/Kin<br />
Extras:  Sensor Dampening<br />
Recommended Damage:  Therm/Kin<br />
<br />
<h3>Single Pocket</h3>

<br />
Upon warp-in, no NPCs.  Agent will message you telling you to attack the outpost.<br />
Note:  All hostiles sensor-dampen, but not very often.  All hostiles aggro soon after spawn and may attack drones.<br />
<br />
<h4>Wave 1 (Shortly after attacking control tower):</h4>

1x Gallente Lieutenant (Elite Federation Navis) spawns at 20 km<br />
<br />
<h4>Wave 2 (About 30s after Wave 1)</h4>

2x Federation Frigates (Praktor Belos, Praktor Harpago)<br />
1x Federation Praktor Hippeus<br />
<br />
<h4>Wave 3 (About 1m after Wave 1):</h4>

2x Federation Frigates (2x Praktor Belos)<br />
1x Federation Praktor Hippeus<br />
<br />
<h4>Wave 4 (Several minutes after Wave 1):</h4>

2x Federation Frigates (Praktor Belos, Praktor Harpago)<br />
1x Federation Praktor Hippeus<br />
<br />
<h4>Wave 5 (On destruction of Waves 1-4):</h4>

7x Federation Cruisers (3x Federation Hastatus, 3x Federation Nauclarius, 1x Federation Misthios)<br />
<br />
<br />
<h5>Blitz</h5>

Killing only the Gallente Lieutenant shows the mission as completing.<br />
<br />
<h5>Structures</h5>

No loot.<br />
<br />
<h5>Tips</h5>

Blowing up the Starbase Control Tower is tougher than normal, but results in the entire outpost exploding building by building in a great fireball.<br />

<span id="comment_692"></span>Needs to be tested, after Waves 1-3, may have trigger spawns. <br />
<br />
I had the following happen:<br />
Fired on Control Tower, shortly thereafter Wave 1 spawned at 20 km with aggro from a Gallente Lieutenant (T2 Cruiser). <br />
<br />
A short period of time afterward, Wave 2 spawned at 35 km with aggro from Federation Nauclarius (Cruiser), 2x Praktor Belos (Frigates). <br />
<br />
After a few more moments, Wave 3 spawned at 35 km with aggro from a Praktor Hippeus (Cruiser), 2x Praktor Belos (Frigates). <br />
<br />
Killed Praktor Belos x4.<br />
<br />
After killing the Praktor Hippeus, Wave 4 spawned at unknown range with aggro from a Federation Hastatus x3 (Cruiser), Federation Misthios (Cruiser) x1. <br />
<br />
Killed Federation Hastatus x3, killed Federation Nauclarius x1, killed Federation Misthios x1 and attacked the Gallente Lieutenant for the first time. <br />
<br />
Right as I fired on the Gallente Lieutenant, Wave 5 spawned at 30 km with aggro from Praktor Hippeus (Cruiser) x1 , Praktor Belos (Frigate) x1 , Praktor Harpago (Frigate) x1.<br />
<br />
Killed Praktor Belos x1, killed Praktor Harpago x1, killed Praktor Hippeus x1, killed Gallente Lieutenant x1<br />
<br />
Complete.<br />
<br />
May/may not be trigger spawned, could just be strange timing. Also notice a difference in the number of ships I listed, my spawns varied (Wave 4 and 5 were switched in order) and my Wave 4 of only cruisers had 3 less ships.

<span id="comment_864"></span>The Lieutenant gas heavy armor tanking, with activ booster. I foynd that the best way to take out his armor is not by Therm or kin, but i used EM on his armor tank. I also got spawned when attacking him. I did this mission in a Ferox with using 5 heavy mis. launcher T2 and had no problems with it.<br />
<br />
Tip: save one frig that flyes withing nos range and put two small nos'es on it if you're using active shield hardners.  <br />
<br />
Loot gives a lot of Gallente insignias wich may be worth some, or used later in LP store. I also salvaged the wreck for a couple of mill. (Using a specified ship with setting for looting and salvaging is recomended) It means running back and worth once or twice, but worth it. i sold the coolant alone for 3.5M So this mission gave me about 15 M all together, roughly calculated...

<span id="comment_1165"></span>Blowing up the Control Tower will drop a 12th tier overseer's personal effects (+/- 9.5M ISK) a shuttle BPO between 400 and 700 starbase charters, between 200 and 300 units of ICE products and between 500 and 1200 units of two types of control tower 'fuel items' such as Robotics, Mechanical parts, Coolant, etc.

<div class="comment">
<span id="comment_1858"></span>I noted significant changes to this mission after the Apocrypha patch. The control tower is destroyed much more quickly, attacking the tower causes only the Gallente LT to spawn, and no fun loot can is dropped upon the destruction of the tower.  You also now receive a -2.4% gallente faction standing loss upon destruction of the tower, which was never received before.  You still receive a small spawn upon attacking and then destroying the Gallente LT.<br />
<br />
After a petition questioning the changes perhaps being due to new graphical updates to control towers, since no mention of any changes to this mission was made at all anywhere in the patch notes, I received this response:<br />
<br />
&quot;Hi, <br />
<br />
This mission has been altered with Apocrypha. We apologize for not including the specific changes that were made to this mission. <br />
<br />
We apologize for any inconvenience this situation has caused you.&quot;<br />
<br />
Yes, not only did they not mention any specific changes to this mission, but they did not mention any GENERAL changes, either.

<span id="comment_3507"></span>Single shot to Station spawned the Lieutenant.  Shots to him spawned his escorts, but after I killed the Lieutenant, mission was flagged complete.  Did not kill anything else, not the escorts or the station (which is good because my Gallente standing is hurting as is). Super easy, just tank the escorts, hit and run if you are grinding for standings.

7x XR-3200 Heavy Missile Launchers<br />
2x Medium FS-9 Regolith Shield Inductions (shield extenders)<br />
1x Medium Ancillary Shield Booster (not really passive, but it's there if I need it)<br />
2x Kinetic Deflection Field I<br />
1x Thermic Dissipation Field I<br />
2x BCUs<br />
2x Beta Reactor Control: Shield Power Relay I<br />
3x Medium Core Defense Field Purger I<br />
<br />
Just kill the Lt. No bounty on the rest so you'd really just be wasting ammo if you went after the rest. You only need to kill the Lt even though it says to kill his guards. Unless you are planning on salvaging.
