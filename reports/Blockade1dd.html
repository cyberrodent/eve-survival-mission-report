Faction: Concord<br />
Mission type: Encounter<br />
Normal space: no gates (note mwd: effectiveness not known as I didn't equip one)<br />
Damage Dealt: All kinds<br />
Extras: conditional waves<br />
Web: yes (stasis tower with range over 100km)/warp scramblers: no<br />
Recommended damage dealing: kin/therm/em/exp, NPCs have equal resists for all damage types<br />
Recommended ship: Rifter <br />
<br />
<h3>Single Pocket</h3>

Upon warpin there is a Stasis Tower and 12-15 enemies in 3 or 4 smaller groups of mixed size and types. When you approach the tower will web you and all soldiers will aggress:<br />
<br />
<h4>Wave 1</h4>

(numbers are approximate) <br />
3 x DED Soldier 1st Class (Frigate)<br />
4 x DED Soldier 2nd Class  (Frigate)<br />
8 x DED Soldier 3rd Class (Frigate)<br />
<br />
<h4>Wave 2, 3 and 4</h4>

Later waves of soldiers similar in composition to the previous waves will warpin at a  fair distance of 30kms or more. Each wave is triggered by the last ship in the preceding wave.There will be many DED soldiers - about 50-60 in the mission  - arriving in four waves of 12-15 ships. <br />
<br />
<h5>Tips</h5>

<ul><li> 1st class DED soldiers represent the biggest threat with the shortest range (7 500m) weapons. 2nd and 3rd class soldiers are less of a threat and fire from a longer range (10 000m).  All soldiers are clustered in groups (about 3 or 4 groups of varying size) per wave. Attack groups separately to try and avoid allowing them to gang up on you. 
</li><li> Until the tower is destroyed warping out is your only defence if you are swamped by the enemy. Drawing the soldiers away from the tower is the first step, then blowing up the tower is the next step. Once the tower is destroyed kill further waves of reinforcements. 
</li><li> Take them out group by group, and don't get nervous when new enemy warpins are triggered. New enemy warpins will be at distance, so try and keep the groups separated. Have a survivable setup.
</li><li> This is a rich mission with muliple objectives.  Firstly destroy the tower, and then kill the waves of concord soldiers - so be prepared. The loot table is biased towards energy/capacitor and electronic warfare. All soldiers drop tags.</li></ul>

Initially I used setup A and found it to have a low survivability. I had lots of speed (max velocity 914m/s), and no long range firepower, so it was easy to keep out of range, but not possible to do damage to anyone. I didn't have enough tank to be able to withstand the damage being dealt by a number of enemies, and couldn't  kite well enough to keep stringing them out. Risky as it was, the speed setup helped to destroy the stasis tower as I was more mobile when webbed. I had some luck by warping out and warping back in and the stasis tower was positioned within my targeting and rocket range.  I didn't seem to be able to bookmark the tower for later warpin.<br />
<br />
To finish the mission I changed to setup B doing maximum damage at range (optimum 10km, and out to 30km) with a smaller speed/shield tank and this was lovely. But I may not have had sufficient speed to survive the first part of the mission while webbed. So I would think in a frigate you have to be careful about your setup, and be prepared to be flexible – the two setups cost about 3 million ISK each, so it is not unrealistic. Of course a larger ship could handle the whole scenario with ease, Tech 2 fitout with support skills would provide more of an edge as well.
