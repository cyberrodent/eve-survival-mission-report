<h3>Pocket 1 of 2</h3>

<br />
<h4>Warp In:</h4>

<br />
8x Frigate (Worker Drone)<br />
<br />
<h4>Spawn 1:  Initiated by attacking Worker Drone</h4>

<br />
4-6x Battleships (Alvus Queen/Matriarch)<br />
12x Frigates (Strain Splinter Alvi/Silverfish Alvi/Strain Silverfish Alvi)<br />
4x Sentry (Drone Cruise Missile Battery/Drone Stasis Sentry I/Drone Energy Neutralizer<br />
 Sentry I) at 74km+ from warp in<br />
<br />
<h4>Spawn 2: Initiated by destroying second to last Battleship.</h4>

<br />
4x Battleships (Alvus Queen/Matriarch)<br />
4x Battlecruisers (Enforcer Alvatis)<br />
<br />
<h4>Spawn 3: Initiates by destroying second to last Battleship.</h4>

<br />
4x Battleships (Matriarch Alvus/Albus Queen)<br />

<h4>Spawn 4:</h4>

<br />
4x Battlecruisers (Crippler Alvatis)<br />
4x Battleships (Alvus Queen/Matriarch)<br />
<br />
<h4>Loot:</h4>

<br />
<span class="strikethrough">Over 3000+ m³ of drone alloys</span> 20kk bounty, making this the heaviest level 4 rogue drone mission, loot-wise.<br />
<br />
<h3>Pocket 2 of 2 (Bonus)</h3>

<br />
<h4>All Aggro on Warp in</h4>

<br />
15x Battleships (Alvus Queen/Matriarch Alvus)<br />
15x Frigates (Strain Sunder Alvi/Strain Raider Alvi/Hunter Alvi/Barracuda Alvi)<br />
10x Cruisers (Striker Alvatis/Defeater Alvatis/Crippler Alvatis)<br />
<br />
Hint: The total ships comes in 3 waves and each wave is trigged by killing the Strain Sunder Alvi's off from each group)<br />
The gallente carrier drops a Federation Navy Fleet Rear-Admiral tag<br />
<br />
Actual advice: This second room broke the tank on my vargur. That hasn't happened in any mission before.<br />
The carrier wreckage (not an actual ship) is based on whatever faction you run the mission for. I got a minmatar carrier wreck from a  <a class="missingpage" href="./SoE.html/edit" title="Create this page">SoE</a> mission, hence I suppose the tag would be of that faction as well.<br />
<br />
Kill the tackle first. Do not warp out if you do not have to, because if you do - the entire mission spawns will be triggered when you come back. You'll be facing volleys of easily 4000 - 6000 DPS. Fit accordingly.<br />
<br />
<h4>Blitz</h4>

<br />
Mission complete when destroying the Infested Station inthe first pocket , no drones have to be destroyed, except scrammers of course.<br />
<br />
<h4>Structures</h4>

<br />
No structures drop loot.<br />
<br />
Total Loot/Salvage Value: ~ 41.600.000 isk  <span class="strikethrough">~59,931,500 isk</span> (see comment below for breakdown)<br />

<span id="comment_5546"></span>The Queen ships will be the biggest inc dmg. Take out the web tower first so you can move, the cruise tower is doing Therm with cruise missiles, the NOS tower sucks at upto 100km so be careful active tankers.<br />
<br />
Fit a good Omni-tank then align and kite just in case you need to warp out. Nothing tried to scramble me, but that doesn't mean they couldn't, as usual kill any frigs that get close.

<br />
2nd room - initial spawn was approx 30 seconds after warp in. then groups would spawn every 5 - 10 seconds (est) I only had 10 BS in 2nd room. lots of frigs and cruisers<br />
I did get webbed and scrammed by frigs in 2nd room.

<span id="comment_5815"></span>Major attack on warp in. Take out NOS tower first at 75km. Then stasis and missile towers. Use your own drones to take the large swarm of frigate drones who web you down. I used Acolyte II light drones. Move away from warp in point to allow time to remove frigates and keep the battleship class drones away. Use long range ammo to take the towers down fast. I used Republic Fleet Titanium Sabot. Switch to EM or therm for the battleships. Confirm 2nd wave spawns on 2nd to last battleship being destroyed. If you're far enough away the 2nd spawn will not aggro. I was 172 km away when they spawned. I would have had to warp out without my alt shield repping me with 5 large shield rep drones. Done with Maelstrom and alt in a Rattlesnake. Fit with 2 invulnerably. fields each. You don't need a passive tank if you take out the NOS tower as soon as you warp in. If you do go passive you will definitely need someone repping you.

2x invuln<br />
a dread x-large booster<br />
and had my salvage alt's noctis fitted with 2 meta 4 large shield transporters(1 on perm, other pulsed) and that was just about enough to tank the last pocket.<br />
<br />
Overall the loot and salvage sold for 45mil(hell yeah!)<br />

The carrier in the bonus pocket dropped over 500 militants and over 500 small arms aswell as a meta3 damage control and 5mil tag<br />

Only got scrammed by a couple of frigs in the first wave of the first room, nothing after that.

<span id="comment_6102"></span>Did this in an Active Tank Vargur.  Killed the Neut sentry before it even hit 15% of my cap (Thanks for the warning).  First spawn (not the workers) came before I even targeted a worker drone.  I received only the tag from the carrier wreck.<br />
<br />
Spawn 3 was skipped entirely for me (Spawn 2 triggered what is listed as Spawn 4), but that might have been because I killed the infested station during Spawn 1, not really sure.<br />
<br />
I was nervous about Pocket 2, but I aligned as soon as I arrived and started picking off frigs as they approached.  The ships arrived in very rapid waves.  I had my drones kill the frigs while concentrated on lowering the incoming DPS from the BS.  There was no ewar in the 2nd pocket for me (maybe I got lucky popping the incoming frigs), so even though my shield was losing ground early on (but it never got below 40%), there was no real danger.<br />
<br />
Best part - 48% corp standing, 12% Faction.

<span id="comment_6120"></span>Completed in a standard fit AC Machariel (+Pith C-type XLSB) + noob alt in an Augoror for cap.<br />
<br />
First room, killed off stasis towers and neut towers, was able to manage incoming DPS with my shieldtank but it helped to speedtank. Split off weapons into two groups to take down frigates more effectively, took them out in order near to far and had no problems with tackle. The only Oh-Sh*t moment was landing until the web/neut towers were down and I was picking off the tacklers.<br />
<br />
Second room: I landed, didn't see any rats at first, started my mach off towards a station. When rats spawned, they were all around, I had to remove tacklers again with 2x grouped guns. DPS from the 10x or so BS was significant, I was forced to use a combination of speedtank and shieldtank to mitigate, however once tacklers were gone the room was manageable. I did not have to warp my mach out, however if you are in a slower ship that can't speedtank, be prepared with a rr or heavy tank.<br />
<br />
The Oh-Sh*t moment in 2nd room lasted from the rats spawning within 20k of me until the tacklers were clear and I was away from the blob. Approx 8-10 tackler frigs between the 3/4 waves that i saw.

<div class="comment">
<span id="comment_6341"></span>Passive shield tank Myrmidion works well for this (all lows Shield Power Relay, Core defense purgers in the rigs, and 2-3 large shield extenders).  Still, it is a good idea to put the stasis tower and NOS tower out as early as possible.  With passive hardeners and good shield skills, though, this one is a breeze.<br />
<br />
Make it go faster with omnilinks and kinetic drones (Hornet, Vespa, Wasp/Warden).  Use small drones (on small and medium enemy drones first) until you have destroyed the two towers, then you can switch to heavy drones/ sentries.  Drones may see aggro, but not much and it is easily manageable (usually when a spawn comes in).<br />
<br />
Auto aggro in the first room includes scrambling and webbing drones, so take them out first (the webbers slow you down even more, and it's always a good idea to keep your &quot;warp door&quot; open).  Try not to target/fire at the worker drones, doing so will invite the next spawn (if you have good skills, though, you can handle it).<br />
<br />
DPS with a passive Myrm isn't that great, so you will probably want to loot and salvage the first room before moving on to the second.

how i'll do it next time in dominix:<br />
1. let infiltrators kill the neutralizer/cruise tower couple first as i needed to slow down to stay in range anyway<br />
2. stasis/cruise tower couple<br />
3. e-war smalls<br />

now it's easy<br />
5. kill all other smalls<br />
6. switch to praetors and kill the larges<br />
7. kill the spawns<br />
<br />
confirmed second to last trigger<br />
<br />
<br />
pocket 2: messed it up too :) what happened:<br />
1. short while after i warped in something like 5 small, 5 medium and 5 large hostiles spawned, which all auto-aggroed - these looked like two groups<br />
2. i ran the opposite direction, started the afterburner and got ready to release the praetors<br />
3. about 3 small and 4 large hostiles spawned where i was heading about 20km from me<br />
4. i aligned to something, decided the hint (see up) is wrong and launched the infiltrators to clear the smalls as i feared some scram is coming<br />
5. after the first small went down more hostiles spawned - i guess this was the spawn 2 5/5/5 (see the hint in question) as my overview filled with reds<br />
6. recalled the drones, warped out<br />
<br />
<br />
i am looking forward to get this mission again and panic less ;)<br />
<br />

faction gain/hit confirmed:<br />
caldari +9<br />

<span id="comment_6996"></span>just did this mission in 0.0 space in the active-tanked tengu. <br />
<br />
Pocket 1. Spawn 1 deploys in a seconds after warp-in, not triggered by any kill. Neut and stasis towers both have pretty low hitpoints so they are no problem if you start to shoot them immediately. Incoming damage sometimes was quite heavy but speed-tank works well (in fact most part of time I orbit gate to pocket 2 with my AB switched on). Strain Disintegrator Alvum looks like the best damage dealers of all.<br />
<br />
Pocket 2. Nothing special. Just be prepared. As soon as you warp in, start to run towards any object using your afterburner. Sort npc by type and shoot 'strain ... alvi'. I wasn't scrambled or webbed in this pocket, may be because all scramblers or webbers died first. After this you can do anything what you want. Overall damage looks lower than in Pocket 1.<br />
<br />
And finally - overall bounty was 35 million. No loot of course. And I saved lives of 535 Marines (along with Basic(!) damage control) from Minmatar carrier wreck

The DPS is rather high so as mentioned before, a good tank that does good dps to take out the drone BS's quickly is a must.

<span id="comment_7717"></span>Be warned the bonus pocket info is OUTDATED and INCORRECT as of July 2013. The first group spawned after about 20 seconds, and ALL remaining waves spawned together after that without touching a single strain sunder alvi. Luckily I tanked just long enough to kill frigs scrambling me to warp out, and get prepared with my alt in an Augorer to feed cap.<br />
<br />
Completed pocket 2 in a Navy Raven with 2 invul, em and thermic active shield tank. My alt held no agro with 2 hardeners, medium armor rep, afterburner and one medium power injector. As soon as I activated second cap injector, I got agro from small ships, but never lost all shields with afterburn running orbiting my main. <br />
<br />
Please take care, I hope this page gets updated... not sure many individuals in a regular battleship could solo this without losing a ship.

<span id="comment_7793"></span>Just blitzed it with my humble T2-fitted Golem. Station is some 22 km from warp-in, rats 70+ km. Pretty sure that all the frigs were already there, rest spawned seconds thereafter. Aligned, locked neut tower and station, blew them up and warped out. DPS is decent (slowly broke my tank) but if you're just into it for the standings it's an easy one.<br />
<br />
As for these: Did it for the Minmatar, standing hits as follows...<br />
Min   + 9%<br />
Gal   + 3.48 %<br />
Cal   - 2.07 %<br />
Amarr - 4.26 %

<span id="comment_7824"></span>I just did the bonus room with an MJDing standard Raven mission fit. MJD really makes survival in any mission trivial. Took a long time to kill the 15 battleships though. I can only imagine how brutal this pocket must have been before MJDs existed, possibly the highest unavoidable incoming DPS of all missions? Plenty of other notorious missions are only &quot;hard&quot; when you mess up, aggro too much.<br />
<br />
I did it for Brutor Tribe, i got a Minmatar carrier wreck in the bonus pocket (Republic Fleet Navy Rear-Admiral Insigna, and some named shield hardener). The wreck behaves like a real wreck in all respects, can be tractored and salvaged.<br />
<br />
Standing hits for me:<br />
Brutor +28.75<br />
Minmatar +8.63<br />
Gallente +6.02<br />

Ammatar -5.30<br />

<span id="comment_7835"></span>I just blitzed this in a 32k ehp basic omni-buffer fit Caracal with mediocre skills and T2 HAMs (410dps with Rage). Infested Station is 22km from warp in. Immediately approached it, got 2 AB cycles off before i was webbed. Just enough to get me well in range of the station. Took it down in like 30 seconds. Wasn't scrammed, warped out with 40% shields and about 35% cap left. Btw, whichever standing boost/loss u take depends on ur current standing as well so it'll vary for everyone.

<span id="comment_8210"></span>Just farmed this mission for the 2nd day in a MJD fitted Golem with Nighthawk providing links. Shield Hardeners used: Exp and Kin. A lot of DPS on this one. I generally MJD out to 100km and snipe at them while tinkering my fit via a Mobile Depot.<br />
<br />
Came away with a Supplemental EM Ward Amplifier from the Fleet Harkal Carrier wreck. EVE Market Price: 50-129mil.<br />
Meta Damage Controls have dropped every time @ 8-10mil.<br />
Salvage: 1.6mil<br />
Tags: Republic Fleet Navy Rear-Admiral Insigna @ 5mil<br />
Bounties: 33mil.<br />
<br />
All in a damn good day at 100mil.<br />
<br />
TOP TIP: If you're doing this mission on behalf of another account\character get them to pod warp to the agent bookmark and bookmark it. Then share it as it's in the same place every time. :)
