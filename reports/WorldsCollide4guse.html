Faction: Gurista Pirates & Serpentis (Gurista Pirates present in the last pocket)<br />
Mission type: Encounter<br />
Space type: Deadspace, with guards at the first gates.<br />
Damage dealt: Kin, Therm<br />
Web/scramblers: Guardian Veteran, Guristas Spies, Dire Pithi Frigates and Angel Vipers. Sidenote: although there are rumours about the Spies on either side to scram, I never had that on me. Same goes to the Guardian Veterans, never hat those scrambling me. The Dire Pithi Frigates will scramble very often though.<br />
Recommended damage dealing: Kinetic<br />
Recommended  ships: CNR, Drake, Tengu, Nighthawk<br />
Video: <a class="ext" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gl0FyaR4doQ">Golem</a> , <a class="ext" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-HxvuFgo68">Vargur</a><br />
<br />
<br />
Choose one of two groups, kill them (you only need to kill the battleships) and go deeper using appropriate warpgate into second pocket (Serpentis base or Gurista base). From both second pockets route is directly to third pocket which is always same (Research outpost).<br />
<br />
<h3>Warp in "Warzone stage"</h3>

<br />
You can blitz this by using Zbikoki's Hacker Card. (Obtained from Zor in other missions). It will be consumed upon unlocking the gate.<br />
<br />
<h4>Serpentis group</h4>

4x Battleships (Core High Admiral/Admiral)<br />
4x Battlecruisers (Corelatis High Capitan/Captain Sentry)<br />
4x Interceptors (Guardian Veterans) <strong>(Web/Scramble)</strong><br />
<br />
<h4>Guristas group</h4>

3x Battleships (Pith Extinguisher/Dismantler)<br />
4x Battlecruisers (Pithatis Revolter/Death Dealer)<br />
<br />
Drones Note:<br />
Drones steal aggro sometimes in Serpentis group. Probably due to range. That never happened to me for the Gurista group though.<br />
<br />
Logistical Note:<br />
non-ganged logistical ships seem to not get aggro. Cloak outside of the clouds between the 2 groups to be safe.<br />
<br />
Tip: if you go from the clouds of Guristas group to the Serpentis group and stop 74k ish from the gate of the Serpentis group only the BS will shoot you. all the rest will be out of range and never get close enough due to some kinda mission setting to stop them going too far from the gate.<br />
<br />
<a class="missingpage" href="./Tip2.html/edit" title="Create this page">Tip2</a>: Both groups have a bunker in the middle of the clouds that they are tied to at around 40km. If they reach that mark they turn back and burn it to the bunker.<br />
<br />
<h3>Serpentis Base</h3>

<br />
For missile spammers: I usualy start from killing BS in aggroing group, because its faster (Serpentis BS have a lot of defenders, from small distance they can't pop your missiles). Drones aggro.<br />
For Tengus and other speedtanks: kill frigates from the first group, then the spies,then other ships (or when u are confident on your tank holding entire pocket (and don't want to switch ammo) kill all frigates first.<br />
<h4>First group, aggro</h4>

3x Battleships (Core Admiral/High Admiral)<br />
3x Battlecruisers (Corelatis Platoon Leader)<br />
3x Interceptors (Guardian Veteran) <strong>(Web/scramble)</strong><br />
2x Interceptors (Angel Spy) <strong>(Web / if shot by second player or drones, they will trigger aggro from the entire pocket)</strong><br />
<br />
<h4>Second group, under you</h4>

3x Battleships (Core Lord Admiral/Grand Admiral)<br />
3x Battlecruisers (Corelatis Platoon Leader)<br />
3x Interceptors (Guardian Veteran) <strong>(Web/Scramble)</strong><br />
<br />
<h4>Third group, behind station:</h4>

3x Battleships (Core Admiral/High Admiral)<br />
3x Battlecruisers (Corelatis Platoon Leader)<br />
3x Interceptors (Guardian Veteran) <strong>(Web/Scramble)</strong><br />
<br />
<br />
<h4>Fourth, behind station, under group 3 </h4>

1x Battleship (Serpentis Overseer) <strong>(<span class="strikethrough">Random</span> <span class="strikethrough">Always spawn</span> Random. Might drop faction loot. See the <a class="" href="./WorldsCollide4segu.html">Serpentis/Gurista</a> version for more info)</strong><br />
<br />
Drones/Gang Members Note:<br />
If you move towards the groups of ships or your drones move close to them you get aggro from them by proximity. Your drones will also draw aggro from every unaggressed ship in the pocket if they attack the Angel Spies, but enemies will deaggro upon recalling your drones to the drone bay.<br />
<br />
Logistical Note:<br />
non-ganged logistical ships seem to not get aggro. Up is a good direction to go.<br />
<br />
<br />
<h5>Blitz</h5>

Edit: Gate is no longer unlocked, date of test September 5th 2012. Same applies to all other gates except the Warzone gates. <br />
<br />
Old text: just kill the Guardian Veterans webbing you, then warp to The Research Outpost.<br />
Alternative Blitz: warp in tanked decoy alt first, so you will not be webbed when warping in your main. This requires two Zbikoki's cards, if combined with the blitz for stage 1, but saves you another minute or so taking down the Guardian Veterans.<br />
<br />
<h5>War installation drops what looks like random junk T1 loot.</h5>
 (2009-02-02)
<br />
<h3>Gurista Base</h3>

<br />
Guristas Spy (25k and 30k frigates) webbing, drones can aggro, same applies for group 4 - the Kyoukan will sometimes attack your drones.<br />
<br />
<h4>First group, aggro</h4>

3x Battleships (Pith Obliterator/Dismantler)<br />
3x Heavy Assault Cruisers (Dire Pithum Abolisher/Eraser)<br />
2x Interceptors (Guristas Spies) <strong>(Web / if shot by second player or drones, they will trigger aggro from the entire pocket)</strong><br />
<br />
<h4>Second group</h4>

3x Battleships (Pith Dismantler/Extinguisher)<br />
2x Heavy Assault Cruisers (Dire Pithum Abolisher/Eraser)<br />
3x Interceptors (Dire Pithi Infiltrators) <strong>(Web/Scramble)</strong><br />

<br />
<h4>Fourth:</h4>

1x Interceptor (Guristas Kyoukan) <strong>(Web/scramble)</strong><br />
<br />
<h4>Fifth:</h4>

1x Battleship (Guristas Overseer) <strong>[Jamming]</strong> (BS, Always spawn <span class="strikethrough">spawns very occasionally</span>, can drop faction loot)<br />
<br />
<h5>Both war stations drops what looks like random T1 junk loot.</h5>
 
<br />
<h5>Blitz</h5>

<br />
None, gate is locked, kill all the ships in this stage to jump to the Research Outpost.<br />
<br />
Logistical Note:<br />
non-ganged logistical ships seem to not get aggro. Up is a good direction to go.<br />
<br />
Salvagers Note: ( Items in Italics needs to be confirmed )<br />
Reports of a random BS spawn are now no longer true - the BS which used to spawn chance based before is now renamed to "Supervisor" and always there at start.  <span class="strikethrough">Be advised when solo salvaging.  The ship is the Overseer.  <em>It has about a 50% chance of physically being in the room in the beggining and another 50% chance of not coming in until a un-determined amount of time.</em></span><br />
<br />
<h3>The Research Outpost</h3>

<br />
<h4>First group (aggroing):</h4>

3x Battleships (Pith Extinguisher/Dismantler)<br />
3x Battlecruisers (Pithatis Death Dealer/Revolter)<br />
<br />
Killing this group will unlock the Heron cargohold<br />
<br />
<h4>Second group:</h4>

3x Battleships (Pith Extinguisher/Eliminator <strong>[Jamming]</strong>)<br />
<br />
<h4>Third group:</h4>

2x Battleships (Pith Obliterator/Dismantler)<br />
3x Cruisers (Pithum Murderer/Ascriber/Silencer/Killer <strong>[Jamming]</strong>)<br />
<br />
Gate in this room is now also locked, its not possible to warp to first room again until you clear all enemies (Date of test September 5th 2012).<br />

<br />
From my expirience (i ran WC more than 100 times), i get Overseer spawn in 1 of 6 missions (Serpentis or Guristas). Even if i get it, most of the cases its a standard BS (under 1m isk, far from it :) with no faction loot. Anyway they can spawn directly when you fly into pocket, or after few hours, or never :-).

<span id="comment_550"></span>Took a recharge Myrmidon from one end to the other. ended up tanking for my friend with a poorly fitted drake. I've run this solo as well. Hit up the serpentis gate first, kill everything, Kill the serpentis pocket and run through and slaughter the final room, rescue the pilots. Then return for the Guristas room and run through the serp room again for the overseer.   Takes a bit alone, but drone DPS gets it done.  Shield tank holds up well with just 2 hardeners.

<span id="comment_928"></span>This mission is no match for a NH fitted with 1 Inv. T2, 1 Balistic T2 , 1 Dread gurista heat amp ( cause of CPU trouble) I used a T2 medium cap inj. just in case, but never fired it in WC. I like to take out the jammers first, then the BS. And agree on the faction loot. It is not often it drops. 1/6 sounds right.

<span id="comment_1644"></span>When you warp in, the two groups are 120-130km off, so if you want, you can bring a sniper ship to that room to easily clear the gates.  I personally like an ishtar, one sensor booster, 2 drone link aug, 1 omni tracking link, and 5 wardens.  (and of course, tank of some kind, I'm in passive one.)<br />
<br />
Then bring your usual ship to the serp gate (try to avoid drone ships unless you can aggro the entire room, kill everything, loop back, go through second gate, kill everything, go through to rescue prisoners, loop back through the serp gate to check for overseer, done.  Takes awhile to do just because the flying time, usually.

<span id="comment_3027"></span>For me (solo), the Gurista's second room was about 650 dps initially, I was scrammed, and intermittently jammed.  I used a web and 4 small artillery cannons and that was sufficient to kill the frigates. Wouldn't recommend this side if you only want to do one side.<br />
<br />
The Serpendis side was trivially easy in comparison.

<span id="comment_4314"></span>I did the entire Guristas section quite easily in my Raven - mostly tech I fitted. Not too much trouble. I went round again, but I had to warp out in the first Serpentis room. For some reason the DPS was considerably higher than the guristas room. It's quite a large mission and I was tired so I just salvaged and handed it in. Be aware that it's best to carry thermal missiles for the serpentis section, I only had Wrath kinetic cruise missiles and my DPS suffered as a result. Also, it would seem Serpentis must have been dealing a larger proportion of thermal damage since they ripped through my shields with ease. Possibly another thermal hardner instead of a boost amp for next time.<br />

<span id="comment_5190"></span>Completed several times w/o warping out.<br />
This mission can take some time, long enough to make wrecks despawn. I've been trying different approaches and this one seems to be the fastest.<br />
I'm running the following setup:<br />
Rattle, 1k dps Serpentis Tank, about 500 dps Guristas Tank, 550+dps therm/kin dmg, 2 fed navy trackers, (Hobos II, Warriors II, Garde II, Warden II, HHeads II, 4xScourge basic/fury)<br />
<br />
1. Pocket - Warzone:<br />
*Get guristas aggro - approach serpentis gate<br />
*While approaching blast away guristas, get aggro on serpentis<br />
*Stop at gate, get out the wardens, try to hold aggro (serpentis tend to loose it here) - give em hell<br />
<br />
2. Pocket - Serpentis Base:<br />
*Target those frigs first, hurl missiles in all general directions, get the whole stage aggro.<br />
This seems like suicide but else they will web and shoot down your drones. I usually switch between Hobos (Veterans) and Warriors (Angel spies), this will reset drone aggro and helps bringing em down faster.<br />
Some people may focus on the battleships first, but i like to play it safe. <br />
<br />
*After frigs have been wiped out switch to garde, fury scourges and get rid of those 8-10km Megas asap. This is where my tank usually goes down to ~24% (1060dps!) and i wet myself.<br />
*Switch to wardens, shoot down the 51km BS, approach the gate.<br />
While approaching  let your mobile drones handle the cruisers. Pocket clear.<br />
<br />
3.Pocket - Outpost<br />
*Easy after Serpentis pocket w/o warping. Moderate jamming.<br />
*Loot - warp back to Warzone - jump to Guristas Base<br />
<br />
2b. Pocket - Guristas Base<br />
*Ships are quite close, so your Gardes should handle everything. Ignore the frigs, take down the BS first as they pack quite a punch. <br />
Keep an eye on your drones as they loose focus all the time here. Sucks.<br />
<br />
Given the dps and tank i mentioned the mission should be finished in about 35-40 minutes, imho quite solid for Worlds Collide.

<span id="comment_5201"></span>I went in through Serpentis Gate with a Navy Scorpion (Faction launchers and Shield Booster). Since my character has only 2.7m SP I decided to bring *two* cap booster modules (800 and 400 charges) which was a wise move and let me finish this mission with only a single warp-out (to buy more cap boosters ^^).<br />
Still, room 2 is nasty because of drone aggro. You cannot simply aggro the whole stage unless you feel a bit suicidical so I just let them out to kill a frig and called them back until nothing was left.<br />
Room 1 and 3 are very easy by comparison.<br />
Comparable in difficulty to Enemies Abound 5/5 although that really depends on how much target range and speed you have in EA 5/5.

With proper aggro management the shields never went below 55%. It was annoying to have most of my dps being shot down by the BS's. Follow the tip and shoot them quickly while they are in close.

<span id="comment_6600"></span>Circumstantial confirmation on the overseer being triggered by warp-in. I almost always run this with a small fleet, and the fourth or fifth warp-in (often my salvager) will almost always spawn the overseer in the serpentis side. I have yet to run this without seeing him.

<span id="comment_6995"></span>Completed with a megathron and dominix. Even though I launched drones after the megathron had stage aggro (all red-boxing), drones still got MAJOR aggro and would be attacked by many ships at once mere seconds after being launched. Once the drones were destroyed or retracted, aggro sometimes went to the dominix or the assault ship that was in the mission for a short time.<br />
<br />
This was seen to happen with both groups in the first room and with the serpentis in the final room with the heron. I wasn't present for the rest of the mission and so don't know if they attack drones.

<span id="comment_7342"></span>Doing this mission right now, I can confirm that Light Drones get aggroed by the Frigates in the Serpentis base (and when you recall them, everything shifts to you), and also that the last pocket, The Research Outpost, has full room aggro as soon as you warp in ...<br />
<br />
DON'T use Light Drones in there, you'll just loose them, but Mediums attacking Cruisers (when there are no more Frigates) look fine ...<br />
<br />
Still the Guristas base to do, but note this : the two Angel Spies in the Serpentis base do EM damage ... they did more to my shields than the Serpentis BSs ...<br />
<br />
Oh, and I got a 3M750K Serpentis Overseer, too ...

I'm doing both sides and the Research Outpost ... nice bounties and loot anyway.
