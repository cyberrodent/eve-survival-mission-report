<span id="comment_39"></span>Please note: The design of this deadspace, as in the individual stages are precisely the same as Enemies Abound 3/5, but with an extra stage tacked on at the end. The rats differ in each stage as well, so don't just rush in and assume everything will work the same<br />
<br />
In the final Pocket <br />
Take out the Orion first, leave the sentries alone as attacking them may draw aggro from everything else. Take out the Interceptors next since they web. From the beginning I was moving away from the structure to give me some room. After the Interceptors take out the 4 officers which do very little damage anyway, but they do shoot lots of defenders.<br />
<br />
After this you are left with the Megathrons and remaining Interceptors (which will web, but I never came close to having to warp out).<br />
<br />
The bottom line is that the Megathrons and last 5 Interceptors did not aggro until I attacked them. Attacking the sentries earlier may aggro them as well as attacking anything other than the Orion at the beginning.<br />
<br />
Structure dropped 1,000 Planetary Vehicles (plus several other goodies) for me and most of the bunkers in Area 2 dropped loot (not just ammo).<br />
<br />
The station itself will soak up around 150K HP of damage. (228 torps, 676.8 damage each, ish).

<span id="comment_627"></span>ElecIcele's version was pretty much right on. But I was rather surprised to see my shield go down so fast in the last pocket when I was only fighting the Patrol Officers and the Interceptors. I then noticed that the Patrol Officers were firing EM heavy missiles at me and I had 0% EM Shield Resist at the time; following the prior guide's version. I think I also saw a hint of an Explosive type of missile damage used by the very last group of mobs in the mission. But I'm not 100% sure so I didn't include it. Good Luck!

<span id="comment_1403"></span>Roids in Pocket 3 are quite a way from the warp in point so bear this in mind when hauling... easiest way is to jet can the lot and haul after you've completed the mission with the agent. Just keep an eye on local for un-friendlies and mission-scanners/can-flippers if you are in a busy area.<br />
<br />
I did this quite easily in a Deimos blaster boat as all the enemies are very close to you, and the frigs, especially, go down very easily so you have little problems being webbed to start with. And the Deimos has an unbreakable tank in this sort of environment because of its very high resists. I didn't see any EM damage being thrown at me, but plenty of Widowmakers... so remember to bring your thermals ;)

<span id="comment_2324"></span>I disagree with taking out the interceptors after the Orion if you have a ship that can tank them. They take a lot of damage to kill. I kill off the patrol officers and then aggro the rest of the pocket killing off the Megathrons. Meanwhile, since the pocket is fully aggro'd my drones start working on the interceptors. When its only the interceptors and station left, the drones continue taking down the interceptors while I work on the station. Much quicker and more efficient use of ammo.

<span id="comment_4400"></span>Actually, in the last pocket, if you get 2 ship in there, one group will attack the first, and the second group will get the aggro of the second. <br />
<br />
if your second ship is a drone you deploy, they will attack it (or them..)

<br />
Destroyed Group 1 with Sentrys, then agro'd group 2 and sent out Ogre's and went to AB to tractor beam range for the wrecks. When I got to around 20km away from Group 3 then they agro'd me.<br />
<br />
Luckily my tank held pretty easily on my Dominix with Dual True Sansha Large Reppers and 1 Therm (T1) and 2 Kinetic Hards (T1).<br />
I did have 1 T1 Aux Nano Pump and 2 T1 CCC's on.

<span id="comment_7839"></span>Again, another mission where it's best to sit still on arrival and fight those which have started to attack oneself.  I did this easily enough in a Drake with Inferno (thermal) heavy missiles.<br />
<br />
The Orion went first, then the little interceptors, then the Officers, then the two sentry guns and then the larger ships.  At no time were my shields in danger of being removed.    The Hobgoblin II drones were on passive and I did manage to lose one of them.<br />
<br />
For the main structure; it took refills of missiles and five drones (I went back for a new one to replace the lost one).  All in all a rather easy mission provining that one stood still and didn't initiate too much aggro.   Then out with the tractor (range only 20 kms alas) and just hoovered up the loot.
