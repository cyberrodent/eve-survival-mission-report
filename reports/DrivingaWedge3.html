Faction: Gallente Federation/Minmatar Republic<br />
Mission type: Encounter<br />
Space type: Deadspace<br />
Damage dealt: Kin/Therm/Exp<br />
Extras: Target Painters<br />
Web/scramble: None<br />
Recommended damage dealing: Part 1 - Therm; Part 2 - Exp<br />
Recommended ships: Nighthawk, Drake<br />
Can drop very good loot.  Federation Tags-High Captain & Admiral<br />
<br />
<h3>Get the Gallente (1 of 2)</h3>

<br />
Spawns appear as you warp in.<br />
<br />
<h4>Pocket 1</h4>

Group 1 - Gallente Federation (Aggro)<br />
Distance: 50km<br />
4-6x Frigates/Destroyers<br />
4-6x Cruisers<br />
3x Battlecruisers<br />
<br />
Group 2 - Minmatar Republic (Aggro)<br />
Distance: 50km<br />
4-6x Frigates/Destroyers<br />
4-6x Cruisers<br />
3x Battlecruisers<br />
<br />
Group 3 - Gallente Federation/Minmatar Republic<br />
Distance: 55km<br />
1x Iteron Mark V (Needed to be killed or you will fail the mission)<br />
1x Mammoth (<span class="underline">Do not attack</span> Minmatar Diplomat)<br />
!Note : Careful sometimes the mission is kill the Minmatar and do not kill the Gallente !!<br />
<br />
Blitz: Kill Gallente Diplomat.<br />
Not really hard-shielded, but combined damage from two groups could likely kill you in process, so - bring some certain amount of firepower or be able to outrun initial aggro. Single-repped Myrm with ~50 resists all-around was held just long enough for a kill score, warped off with 5% armor left.<br />
<br />
<h3>Delegation Destruction (2 of 2)</h3>

<br />
Spawns appear as you warp in.<br />
<br />
<h4>Pocket 1</h4>

Group 1 - Minmatar Republic (Aggro)<br />
Distance: 50km<br />
3x Frigates (target painting)<br />
6x Destroyers<br />
3x Cruisers<br />
1x Battleship (Flagship)<br />
<br />
<h5>Blitz:</h5>

Kill the Flagship first, because it may warp off, but not 100% sure of this.<br />
It's very, VERY hard to crack, unless you're in battleship yourself, and incoming damage from whole spawn is very high also.<br />
<br />
If you can't tank 500+ DPS EX/TM, I suggest you forget about blitz.<br />
Take destroyers down fast. They are (relatively) slow and short-ranged, not particularly hard to outrun, so you have plently of time for your drones to chew through them one by one. Use light drones, however...<br />
It didn't warped off for me, so I vent on with Dualrep+AB Myrmidon, cleared adds, then refitted for usual 1rep+2Gyro and took a liberty of stocking heavy drones in the bay. Still, it was slow kill.<br />

<span id="comment_1323"></span>I think it's good to add here that once you attack and kill the Gallente Diplomat, all the Minmatar ships will warp off. This is perfectly normal. They are not supposed to be attacked in the first place, and specifically not the Minmatar Diplomat.

Killing that battleship with my drake was impossible for me. Something better than a battlecruiser is needed, I guess. I killed everything else and the flagship did NOT warp out. It likes to keep 36km from you. Fires devastator cruise missles plus... and has a shield amplifier/regenerator or something. 10MN afterburner can catch up for assault missles, but then it speeds up... tricky

<span id="comment_1843"></span>Part 1: Mission complete as soon as the diplomat died, I found the highest damage on the Minmatar diplomat was done by EM on his shields and then Kinetic for armor/hull (I'm flying a caracal so I get bonus from kinetic).<br />
<br />
I declined the first one that asked me to kill the Gallente diplomat, and next the agent gave me the version to kill the Minmatar.  Using 5 assault missile launchers and target painters some of the ships were slow to die, and none of them have bounties so it's best to ignore them.

<span id="comment_2209"></span>Part 2: I killed Flagship in my Battlecruiser Drake (one and half month EVE player).<br />
Useful Fit in this mission:<br />
Havoc Heavy Missile - best explosive damage against that BS,<br />
2x Explosion Dampering Field I<br />
1x Target Painter I<br />
1x 10MN Afterburner I - to get to him in range for my drones and launch the drones to help^^<br />
2x Ballistic Control System II.<br />
(a &quot;typical&quot; Drake can't make it. Salvaging wrecks you can earn about 1,5 mil additionally.)

<span id="comment_3251"></span>i just did this in a drake, using T1 meta 4 heavy missle launchers x7 with T2 ballistic controls x2.  i get 20% bonus ONLY from kinetic damage type (scourge).  battleship in part 2 was federation praktor hyperion (gallente federation ship.  not same as gallente navy ship.  diff resistances.).  gallente federation ships are hit best with kinetic from what ive seen, by far.  i brought all 4 types of heavy missles into the battle with me to test this explosive theory.  i hit for over 850 w scourge (kinetic), about 520 w widowmaker (thermal), and about 350 - 400 with thunderbolt (em) and havok (explosive).  this is consistent w normal gallente federation ship resistances.  why is explosive recommended here???

<span id="comment_3800"></span>Completed in a Drake, had to take out the Frigate/Cruiser support first as I couldn't tank the DPS (I had the wrong shields fitted, doh!). Fired Widowmaker Heavy Missile at it along with using Hobgoblin II Drones, went and made a cup of tea and it was gone when I came back. I'd recommend using Explosive and you'll kill it quicker.

<span id="comment_3806"></span>I've only been playing for about 3 weeks so all this T2 talk is a little beyond me.  I was able to defeat the battleship...  barely.  I have a ubiquitous passive Drake setup, using missiles.  This solution should also work for turrets and lasers.  For those of you who are in the same boat as me, try the following.<br />
<br />
Disclaimer: Should your multi-million isk ship explode in a dramatic fashion while attempting this, it's all... uh... ChorusBeck's fault.  Not for any good reason, it's just the first name I saw.<br />
<br />
Step 1. Buy more insurance.<br />
<br />
Step 2. Clear out everyone except the battleship.  Warp in and out as required.<br />
<br />
Step 3. The worst thing about the battleship is its shield regen, right?  So don't let it.  Fit an AB and an *energy destabilizer*.  Get in nice and close, firing all the way.  Start the energy destab once in range and keep it up.  Eventually, you will notice the shields will stop regenerating.  Now the only thing you have to worry about is your own shields.  He dropped me to 1/4 armour before he blew.  In hindsight, I should've gotten out of there, but I stayed and survived.<br />
<br />
I hope this helps some newer players.

<span id="comment_4410"></span>Part 2: Drake, 2.2 mil SP character with t2 shields and t1 launchers, 1 Thermal and 1 Explosive hardener, 1 t1 inv field. In spite of kinetic bonus to Drake, explosive works best. Cruisers and frigs are tough - the BS on the other hand has a lot of shield regeneration and fires defenders but doesn't deal a lot of damage. <br />
<br />
I equiped an AB and an extra Ballistic Control and got very close so he couldn't use the defenders and I could use my drones (BS stays at 36 km otherwise, my drones only reach 35 km). It requires some patience but once you break its shield it is down pretty quickly. Did mission 4 times now, isn't as hard as for example the Blockade mission.

Was worried about it due to comments, but incoming DPS wasnt a problem, never fell below 41% shields and as soon as it was just the BS and cruisers left shields slowly stabilized and started to climb. I use assaults, so I couldnt keep up with the BS, so jumped to station to swap an Azeo for an AB, then duked it out with him for around 7 minutes before he popped.<br />
<br />
7xArbalest Assaults<br />
1x Drone Link<br />
4x Azeo Extenders<br />
2x Multispectral Bracers<br />
4x Ballistic Control Is<br />
5x Hobgoblin Is<br />
Used Flamebursts for everything but the BS, switched to Piranhas for it (took exactly 72 volleys to kill it) <br />
Without the 4th Azeo, he kept me at around 56% shields.

Using a Drake, on 2/2 I was using Thermal missiles on the Gallente Battleship and could barely damage it's armour, swapped to Kinetic missiles and its armour melted like butter.

I took from a couple recommendations and thought this would help others.  It wasn't pretty, but it worked!!<br />

Cleared the adds, then fitted these low level mods to my drake:<br />

7 arb heavy (havoc missiles)<br />
50w Infectious Power System Malf (energy neut)<br />

3x med core defence field purger 1<br />
<br />
Strat:<br />
<br />
Get in tight w/ afterburner, took 2min at 311m/s.  shields down to 25% left<br />
<br />
Got to 10km - kicked on webby, energy neut, and cap booster (on all fight), and turned off afterburner (much better cap usage) <br />
<br />
Used 3 tech 1 hornet drones (again, no skills, and these were probably worthless)<br />
<br />
With all my eq activated except afterburner, I started orb'ing the bs at 2500 at a speed of 161ms.  Cap held steady at 50%<br />
<br />
the tight orb from webifer dropped the bs damage by more than 80%, and took out the defensive missles ability to stop my heavies.<br />
<br />
the energy neut dropped shield regen by 50% (eventually).<br />
<br />
all told, 7min fight, noob 160dps drake who had to train skills to fit mods for mission, got the time bonus with 3 hours to spare.

3. Generate more than 600dps (I used 7 Heavy Missile Launchers with Havoc Heavy Missiles)<br />
4. Orbit him at 8.5km (he doesn't hit you as much then)<br />
5. Keep your drones on him<br />
6. Have 2 Kinetic, 1 Therm and 1 Heat Amplifiers<br />
<br />
I also had<br />
Rigs 2 Medium Defense Core Purgers and 1 Medium Bay Loading Accelerator<br />
1 Ballistic Control System<br />
1 Large Shield Extender<br />
<br />
They key to this fight is getting in, circling him and using explosive ammo<br />
<br />
Good luck

<span id="comment_5029"></span>Just to add to my comment...<br />
<br />
The BS Dropped 2 Fleet Commander tags (800k each) and Salvaged into to 4 Tritanium bars (125k each) <br />
The rest of section 2 yielded 4 Rep Fleet Captain (150k each) and 4 Rep Fleet Private (25k) and Assorted Salvage worth 500k<br />
<br />
So about 3.3 Mil in goodies and 1.3 mil in Agent rewards makes for a good reason to persist at this one.

<span id="comment_5139"></span>Part 2 isn't *that* hard in a &quot;normal&quot; Drake. With 3 ballistic upgrades (1 faction 2 T2) I just afterburned away from the ships and killed everything except the BS which was at 86 km when all other ships were destroyed. <br />
Then, afterburn towards the BS and just keep firing + droning. It does some pretty good turret damage but with cap rigs and normal explosive missiles it is definitely not all too hard to kill. Shields are tough, armor+hull are relatively easy to take down.

<span id="comment_5242"></span>I finished the flagship bs (Republic Tribal Ymir) using &quot;Caldari Navy Havoc Heavy Missile&quot;. With 7x &quot;Malkuth Heavy Missile Launcher 1&quot; it gave me enough volley damage (800-850) to destroy him. I used about 500-600 these missiles.<br />
<br />
With standard heavy havoc missiles i got 704 volley damage on him (with the same 7x malkuth) which was not enough to break his tank.

<span id="comment_5354"></span>2nd part of this mission is hard, but still can be completed alone, using a battlecruiser and without high skill levels. I did it on a Harbinger. The only problem was the flagship (seems to be a Tempest class battleship if I am not mistaken), its shields regenerate very quickly, em\thermal damage does very low damage against them. I equipped 4 Valkyrie I drones (explosive dmg), 7 Focused Modal Pulse lasers (Imperial Navy multifrequency), 2 Skadi Coolants, N-type Kinetic\Explosive hardeners for tank, Armor repairer II. Cap Circuit rigs, 3 Cap II rechargers (to make my cap stable with everything on and gunz blazing). Kept at distance of 4km from the target, soaking up the incoming damage with rep. It took me hell knows how much time to finally rip through the flagship's shields, then his armor goes down pretty fast.

(3x Large Extender II, 1x Invuln Field I, 3x Purge I, 5x Hammerhead II, 5x Valkyrie II, DC II, 2x Shield Power Relay)<br />
<br />
1st part: Drop drones and slow-boat in the opposite direction.<br />
<br />
2nd part: Slow boat away from everything, pop small boats and 1-2 cruisers before pointing yourself and the flagship. Once everything else is dead, just let your drones take care of the BS. Might take a while, but you can just go do something else while your Valkyries take him down.

<span id="comment_6979"></span>I run L3 missions in a Drake, and only got 1.5 million SP, and I have a different take on part 2 of this mission for a new player.<br />
<br />
1. Kill the Target painting frigates first. Remember to launch drones.<br />
2. Let your drones work the Dessies, while you take out a few cruisers until you can tank the combined DPS.<br />
3. Reload missiles (Novas), approach the flagship while bombarding it continuosly.<br />
4. Profit<br />
<br />
Problem for a low SP player is that it takes a long time to take down the flagship (somewhere between 5-10 minutes - the shield is tough to crack), and you can't tank the combined damage of the NPC's for that long - but if you lower the number of ships firing at you you can buy yourself enough time to take down the Ymir. I have done this mission countless times, without the need for warping out in this low-skill setup:<br />

<span id="comment_7762"></span>Could not do enough DPS in my standard Drake fit so (after killing all the other ships in the mission) I switched the target painter for a webifier, and put a small energy neut in the 7th high slot, then switched in heavy assault missile launchers (w/ novas). Orbited at 4000m, once in range of the webifier I could shut off my afterburner to save cap and turned on the neut once close enough. Killed it with 1 reload.
