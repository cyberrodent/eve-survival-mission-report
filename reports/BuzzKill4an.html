<br />
Note: The naming convention under the Overview for "Type" and "Name" seems to be swapped. This results in "Angel Assault Cruiser" being seen as the default name, instead of "Arch Gistum Phalanx". <br />
<br />
<h3>Single Pocket</h3>

<br />
Single deadspace pocket, no gates. All groups/spawns will auto-aggro. Watch your drones as new spawns will target them.<br />
Also, make sure your drones are not taking out trigger ships causing you to be swarmed.<br />
<br />
<strong><span class="underline">Trigger ships will always be the last ship killed in a particular group.</span></strong><br />
<br />
<h4>Initial Group: (25km)</h4>

5x Angel Assault Cruiser (Arch Gistum Centurion/Phalanx) <strong><em>Triggers Second Group</em></strong><br />
<br />
<h4>Second Group: (15km)</h4>

1x Angel Frigate (Arch Gistii Ruffian/Thug) <strong>Web/Scramble - <em>Triggers Chain A - Spawn A1</em></strong><br />
4x Angel Assault Frigate (Arch Gistii Hunter/Impaler) <strong><em>Triggers Chain B - Spawn B1</em></strong><br />
<br />
<h4><span class="underline">Chain A :</span></h4>

<span class="underline">Spawn A1</span><br />
3x Angel Frigate (Arch Gistii Ruffian/Nomad) <strong>Target Painter - <em>Triggers Spawn A2</em></strong><br />
<br />
<span class="underline">Spawn A2</span><br />
4x Angel Assault Cruiser (Arch Gistum Centurion/Phalanx) <strong><em>Triggers Spawn A3</em></strong><br />
<br />
<span class="underline">Spawn A3</span><br />
4x Angel Assault Cruiser (Arch Gistum Centurion/Phalanx) <strong><em>Triggers Spawn A4</em></strong><br />
5x Angel Battlecruiser (Gistatis Tribunus/Legatus) <strong><em>Triggers Spawn A4</em></strong><br />
<strong>Note:</strong> Kill all but one of each.<br />
<span class="underline">Spawn A4</span><br />
4x Angel Frigate (Arch Gistii Thug/Outlaw) <strong>Web/Scramble</strong><br />
3x Angel Destroyer (Gistior Seizer)<br />
4x Angel Cruiser (Arch Gistum Defeater/Breaker) <strong><em>Triggers Final Group</em></strong><br />
<br />
<h4><span class="underline">Chain B:</span></h4>

<span class="underline">Spawn B1</span><br />
3x Angel Assault Frigate (Arch Gistii Hunter) <strong><em>Triggers Spawn B2</em></strong><br />
2x Angel Cruiser (Arch Gistum Defeater/Breaker)<br />
<br />
<span class="underline">Spawn B2</span><br />
3x Angel Assault Frigate (Arch Gistii Impaler) <strong><em>Triggers Spawn B3</em></strong><br />
<br />
<span class="underline">Spawn B3</span><br />
3x Angel Assault Frigate (Arch Gistii Hunter/Impaler)<br />
<br />
<h4>Final Group: (6km)</h4>

4x Angel Battleship (Gist Warlord/Saint)<br />
<br />
<h5>Tips</h5>

<ul><li> Misson is flagged completed after you have killed the last battleship in the Final Group.
</li><li> All battleships will fight using Bane Torpedoes. Other missile damage should be neglectable.</li></ul>
<br />
<h5>Blitz</h5>

<ul><li> Kill Initial Group
</li><li> Ignore Chain B (Angel Assault Frigates), and focus on Chain A, starting with the single Angel Frigate. 
<ul><li> When A3 spawns, kill one of the two kinds (Angel Cruisers will make it easier to do A4.)
</li><li> When A4 spawns, kill the scrambler frigates (by this time you might be taking tons of damage) and then the Angel Cruisers.
</li></ul></li><li> Kill ALL battleships.
</li><li> NOTE: With the new drone changes, it becomes difficult to blitz this particular mission unless you are willing to sacrifice drones at the end (Align to object, deploy drones, let them get aggro, recall and warp, some or all will pop) or to pop all the scram frigs along the way as well. Or mount a MJD and snipe the triggers from afar, then MJD again after its all done to get away.</li></ul>
<br />
<br />
Note: Some people think that this mission is not worth doing, claiming that isk/hour is very poor due to the many small targets, hence long locking times and large guns incapable of hitting small targets. An easy way to remedy is to fit a sensor booster and to fly away from the Angel Scout Post around which all ships spawn. A distance of 50 km is advisable for long range ships (e.g. rail guns, artillery and beam lasers), a distance of 35 km will be sufficient for ships with close-ranged weapons (pulse lasers and autocannons). That way all Angel ships spawn in your optimal range and can be locked and destroyed quickly while approaching. This basic mission running tactic enables mission completion in under 20 minutes and therefore makes Buzz Kill a desirable mission if you have a high-quality agent!<br />
<br />
A jump drive will be your friend during this mission. It's much easier to take everything out from a distance.<br />
<br />
If you are using drones, and if they start shooting at your drone. Just bring your drones in for a second. <br />

<span id="comment_818"></span>If you are using drones, it is very, very, very important to set your drones to PASSIVE. That way you can be sure that the drones won't accidentally kill a trigger.<br />
<br />
If you do hit too many triggers, the DPS output of multiple spawns combined could possibly overwhelm your tank.  For that reason, I suggest that you sort the rats by NAME.  That way you can easily distinguish between each group of rats.<br />
<br />
Also, always leave one rat alive at the end of each group, e.g. if you are up against Spawn 1, kill 3 Angel Destroyer and then 11 Angel Frigate before procceding to kill the final ship / trigger for either group.<br />
<br />
I also found the spawns to be slightly different to how they are described above.  After Spawn 1, I've split them into 2 Chains.:  <br />
<br />
<br />
Initial Group (Auto-Aggro)<br />
8 Angel Frigate, last triggers Spawn 1<br />
<br />
<br />
Spawn 1<br />
12 Angel Frigate, last triggers Spawn 2<br />
4 Angel Destroyer, last triggers Spawn 5<br />
<br />
Chain A<br />
<br />
Spawn 2<br />
12 Angel Frigate, last triggers Spawn 3<br />
8 Angel EW Frigate<br />
<br />
<br />
Spawn 3<br />
11 Angel Frigate, last triggers Spawn 4<br />
<br />
<br />

13 Angel Assault Frigate<br />
<br />
<br />

10 Angel Destroyer, last triggers Spawn 6<br />
<br />

Spawn 7<br />
7 Angel Cruiser, last triggers Spawn 8<br />
7 Angel Battlecruiser<br />
<br />
<br />

11 Angel Assault Frigate<br />
8 Angel Battlecruiser, last triggers Spawn 9<br />
8 Angel Destroyer<br />
<br />
Spawn 9<br />
4 Angel Battleship<br />
<br />
<br />
I haven't commented on whether they target-paint or not, or how far away they spawn in.  If I get the mission again, I'll run it slowly to check their spawn distance from the warp-in point and their orbiting distance.

<span id="comment_852"></span>Several people have suggested smart bombs. In low sec or 0.0, smart bombs are great. Unless you really know what you are doing (and are still willing to risk getting concorded), I recommend people avoid smart bombs. Or at least take a cheaper setup than you normally use for this mission if you are going to use them.

<span id="comment_939"></span>I don't believe this mission is worth it in a domi.  In .5 space, I got around 6.5 mil in bounties, 3.5 mil in reward, around 100 salvage of varing types, 1,000 m^3 of various regular t1 loot, a HUGE headache managing targets, and risk to your drones and more.  Plus, passive drones with a domi sucks ass, which lead this to take two hours, including salvage.  I got a mix of the listed attack, and part of the one that Sazukakirr got.<br />
<br />
The only advantage to this mission is that none of them seem to scramble.<br />
<br />
My general rule was: kill all but one of everything.  Then, kill the smallest thing out there. This lead to a pretty decent escalation path.  Only had to turn on second repper for some of the Battlecruiser stages, and one of the assault frigate stages.  In general, my kill order was: frigates, destroyers, EW frig, assault frig, cruiser, battlecruisers.  By the time I got to the Battleships, I was relieved because they were easy in comparison.<br />
<br />
Note: have the Ship type column turned on.  I don't know if you can have one Ship name ('Angel Frigate') lead to two spawns when you kill off two different ship types ((Gistii Raider / Gistii Ambusher).<br />
<br />
And if you're doing small drones, make sure they get inside, because I had one easily popped by all the frigates.  Maybe for the last one, use hammerheads or something so it can at least hold up to the fire.

<span id="comment_951"></span>Based on SazukaKirr's idea... Spawn 7 somehow's are the Battlecruiser that trigger's the last spawn... <br />
for Spawn 8... Kill the BC/Cruiser first... till you left each of them left 1 :) , as i try to hit the frig's first with heavies (in a raven with 3XPurgers and 2X heat II Amps and 2X explosion amps), it almost takes down my in less then 30 seconds... where i sustained a total of 1k armor damage, before warping out :( reason being that they deal load's of damage.. + swarming you can makes you nervous with THAT ammount of ships... -_-&quot;<br />
<br />
i have tried to destroyed the angel Lookout before spawn 6, and looks like spawn 7 still comes out as usual :(

<span id="comment_976"></span>Destroyed the lookout @ the beginning of the mission, waves 7,8,9 still spawned. Doing the mission in an Absolution is a pain since those ~50 little assault frigs have resists against lazers... Even the machariels blow up faster than the frigates

<span id="comment_1000"></span>Flew this in an AC Vargur - very easy up to spawn 8, when i had to actually concentrate a little and use my SB for the first time.  Can kite the frigs - NONE appear to use MWD.  After a while (100km+?) they stop chasing and turn around - annoying!<br />
Spawns didn't quite match above - after a while i gave up keeping track and just shot stuff!

<span id="comment_1073"></span>The key for this is to fit an AB..<br />
Cleared in an Ishtar.<br />
1. Created some distance while taking out some frigs with Warrior II:s<br />
2. After the getting enought of distance, stopped the ship and started to clear the sky with Bouncer II:s<br />
If some ships got all the way to me (rarely happened) repeated the step 1.<br />
<br />
Really easy mission if you can keep your distance, since almost none of them will shoot you if you are over 40km from them. But I'd imagine it to hurt like hell getting swarmed by that blob.<br />
<br />

This setup let me basically shoot whatever I wanted. No overwhelming DPS at any time. I aligned to a station and set speed to around 20m/s. Started with Warrior IIs and brought them back for a little bit if they took damage.<br />
<br />
This slowboating strategy kept the massive amount of wrecks in a pretty tight group. I only had to use my cane with 4/4 setup and AB it around 320m/s down the line. Not many detours.<br />
<br />
9m in bounties. 28 ATBs, 10 armor plates and other various stuff. I estimate around 18m total.

<span id="comment_1787"></span>Redid this mission in a CNR, (1 invul, 1 explo, 1 kin actives)  And I brought a rack of warrior II and Valkyrie II's.  This time, killed all but one of each ship type (don't get wrapped around the axle of nomad versus ruffian, the last frigate is the last frigate), and the proceeded with the biggest ship out there. Went pretty smoothly, no real problems, just make sure to pull drones back in time between waves.  Next time, bringing a painter, even with cruises.  The assault frigates take the longest in this setup though.

Took 3000 cruise missiles, half hour to finish mission, half hour to finish killing everything (will most likely blitz next time), half hour to salvage everything, resulting in 970 m^3 of loot, 176 units of salvage (30 some valuable), 5 sell-able meta items, rest melted to 239k trit at the high end for 2.7 mil in minerals

<span id="comment_1888"></span>Cautionary Tale: I lost a Domi on this by not paying attention to the advice on offer :) Too cocky and thought I could tank the DPS - I have pretty solid Armor tank skills...<br />
<br />
Done it since in a passive shield (look on BattleClinic) Ishtar with T2 Valkyries (explosive damage) Pretty straightforward so long as you do what people advise and watch the triggers - best advice on offer here is the &quot;leave one of each ship type alive&quot; bit.<br />
<br />
The only time the DPS gets tough is when you get the Assault Frigate swarms. Ishtar shield tank never dropped below 40% though when taking all that and I took them down first. The big ships are nothing to worry about.

<br />
Tried using a 5xblaster/3xsmartbomb fit, but the close range damage was to much for me. Not to mention that all ships will spread around, making the smartbomb kinda of useless.<br />
<br />
After 3-4 warp outs, finished by using my regular fit, with 7x425mm Railguns. Got close to structure a few times, worst during the 5 BC/4 Cruiser spawn. Little under 2 hours to complete.<br />
<br />
Enemy ships have high resistance to kin/therm damage, making it a lot slower for hybrid based ships.<br />
<br />
Pay attention to damage, and don't underestimate it. Other than that, challenging mission, but not worth the rewards, given the risk to loose your ship. Almost no loot, salvage includes Tritanium bars/Armor plates, the 4 circuit boards and some garbage.

<span id="comment_3679"></span>actually smartbombs are dumb idea if you fly a ship that hasnt an utility highslot (abaddon, maelstrom, etc)<br />
just completet it really fast in a maelstrom and i think a grande total of 4 frigs and 1 cruiser went into smartbomb range. and i didnt use it much cos its capacitor draining. i regret that i was too lazy and did not fly back to the station and replace the useless bomb with a 8th gun.<br />
<br />
some hints after dominion:<br />
use autocannons, 8x 800mm ac II an AB, a shield tank and 2x trakcing enhancers II and 3x gyros II<br />
with dominion changes u have ca.  38km falloff. (depending on skills)<br />
<br />
approaching the elite frigs that orbit around 12k full speed makes them fly away and u kill them much faster with large AC then 5x warrior IIs ever could.<br />
<br />
against another comment above: there are warpscrambling frigates in this mission, seen up to 2 scrambler symbols in the overview at a time and had scrambling within different waves.<br />
<br />
either the battlecruisers or a wave of assault cruiser fire EM missiles. so shield-tankers without invuls -&gt; kill them asap :)<br />
<br />
and again - just forget the smartbomb idea if you dont have officer Smartbombs with more range :) the projectile ammo of choice schould be fusion  and maybe hail for BCs and BS spawns if you dont shy some expenses

Even when another character webs and target paints the NPCs, little damage is done because of high resists. Medium guns just don't do enough damage and I'm not chasing them to use blasters.<br />
<br />
Two dominix with target painters and drones doing explosive damage can run the mission with no problem. (Pull drones in after each wave.) One dominix takes too long to be worthwhile.

I found that taking out chain B before chain A was easiest route.  Using Berzerker IIs on anything cruiser/HAC really sped up the killing alot,  then warrior IIs for the frigs and AFs.  Bouncers IIs for BC's when they arrive.<br />

Other than that  Spawn A2 only has 4 Hacs instead of 5 from my experience.

I took my worst pilot (zero bonus rewards books, armor spec piloting a shield tanked Mael, no particular implants), at a mediocre agent (Fricoure) with not stellar standings as it's not a PvE character. Maelstrom slapped together fitted with regular T2 and T1 ammo, Meta4 shield (!).<br />
<br />
Got about 8.4M bounties in about 15 mins + about 1.2M reward + 3656 LP + 1.46M bonus. Even selling LP to the worst possible conditions at 500 ISK / LP, I get a total of 12888000 ISK.<br />
<br />
This means 12888000 * 4 = 51552000 = about 51.5M per hour excluding fitting times and travel (same system though).<br />

Think I'll bring AC Mael next time though; the inbound DPS wasn't enough to worry over, it's just a matter of plodding through the loads elite cruisers, so DPS trumps tank I think.

<span id="comment_6627"></span>This is fast and fairly easy if you are running in a battleship capable of reasonable DPS. The easiest method I've found to date is to kill the chain B triggers (4 X Assault Frigates) and run up chain B to the end, then go back and kill up chain A to the end. Depending on your fit and what the first frigate in chain A does you may want to kill it (it's about 50-50 web/scram - if it webs and you rely on speed, kill it and 2 of the target painters from A1, otherwise leave it alone).<br />
<br />
Assault Cruisers are fairly tough with good DPS and resists. They're the only time you might find your shields/armour under real threat. Certainly for me, the BS at the end die much faster than the ACs.<br />
<br />
But the whole mission, now I'm used to it, takes about 45 minutes from getting it to fully salvaged and home.

<span id="comment_7035"></span>I just did this mission for the first time today and see why I took the advice that this missions wasn't worth the time. I actually finished it in about 20mins. However most of the ships were frigs that cost me more in ammo than what the bounties are worth. When salvaging the first 2 items were worth over 1m each and I thought yay this might be worth it. Not! Those were the only 2 things I got worth anything. In total the salvage and loot I got were worth about 6-7m. In other words this mission is a waste of ammo. Bounties on cruisers were nice but I would rather kill BS's for better bounties and salvage with the same amount of time and ammo. Very few BS's in this mission.

<br />
Took 2 hours. Really isn't worth it if you rely on drones for damage. This mission shows up the downside of using drones. Drones are constantly targeted and killed if not withdrawn fast enough. But then they just aim at one of the remaining drones. Not possible for the ship to keep agro off the drones. RATs just change target to the drones. <br />
<br />
Only got 1.7m in bounty prizes and about 30 salvage items. New drones cost more than that. Ship was never in danger, just the drones. Probably a very different issue if using a missile boat.

<br />
Raven and Myrm fitted with mission-specific tank and munitions (Raven had Nova Fury Cruise Missiles and a full drone bay of Warrior II drones).<br />
<br />
Took the advice of other missioneers, and used an MJD to put some distance between my Raven and the warp-in point. Then picked off the groups as they spawned, always leaving one ship of each group alive until I was ready for the next spawn. Took about 1 hour to clear all the NPCs, chewed through 15 Warrior IIs and 2 repper drones and my Logi Myrm came under heavy DPS at one point, but tactical flying (high tangential V to aggressing groups at all times) and keeping at maximum weapons range saw me through evenutally.<br />
<br />
Loot and salvage was a little disappoitning, but a good mission for honing combat and logi support tactics.

Mission is a bit of a chore. Microjumpdrive is highly recommended. This took me outside targeting range of many of the spawns, so bastion is not highly recommended, i was switching between hail and barrage depending on the engagement range.<br />

Drop tractor unit and jump 100km off, then pick everything off at long range, with priority to frigates (so they dont get under your tracking) i never had anything get closer than 50km.<br />
