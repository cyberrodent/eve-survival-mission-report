<span id="comment_1131"></span>The first 3 spawns will come from a quite large distance (100 km +), keep that in mind if you want to accomplish the mission fast. I highly recommend the use of the fitting suggested in the mission description (1 therm, 2 kin, 1 invul) because there is pretty heavy thermal damage for a Gurista mission.<br />
<br />
In spawn 3 I encountered 3 x Pithathis Enforcer , 3 x Pithatis Executor and 3 cruiserclass ships. Killing all Enforcers triggered the next spawn. Spawn 4 comes up very close (15-20 km from warpin), in my mission there were 4 Pithathis Death Dealer, killing the first completed the mission.

<span id="comment_1466"></span>This time the I was nearly overwhelmed when I accidentally triggered the first wave almost as soon as I warped in. Had to warp out twice during initial 2 waves. After that I was able to stay until end, finishing all consecutive waves/triggers.

<span id="comment_1563"></span>If you use the trigger well you should have time to reload and allow your tank to regen before you pop the last ship. Had I not taken a breather for a few moments before each wave I would have been easily overwhelmed.<br />
<br />
I completed this in this Drake: <br />
<br />
7x Limos heavy Launcher I's<br />
2x Invul II's, 1 Kinetic Amp II, 1 LSE II, 2x SR II's<br />
2x BCU II's, 1x SPR II, 1x PDS II<br />
<br />
I spawned the fourth wave too soon and was forced to warp out and kite the jammers for 100km.

<span id="comment_1915"></span>I also got varied spawns. I noticed, at least for first; second; third; and fourth waves, the triggers were the single rats that stayed the farthest away from you. Might not be the case for everyone, but was the case for me.

<span id="comment_1991"></span>Just a word of warning...it took me four hours to do this mission in a Prophecy.  There's a lot of DPS, a lot of targets, and they all have absurd range (particularly the jammers, which can nail you at &gt; 250 km...riiiiiight).

<span id="comment_2177"></span>This is probably the hardest level3 mission. It takes years to complete even with a well fitted and rigged Drake (21k shield + T2 resists + 7x missilers) Im talking of no less than 4 hours doing it solo.<br />
<br />
The worst part is the final splash, when you are already tired, and tons of moronic frigates come and jam all the way.<br />
<br />
Strongly suggested to bring a friend with another Drake.

<div class="comment">
<span id="comment_2344"></span>Do NOT, under NO circumstances, try this mission as a beginner. Even with a 90% kinetic res Drake they will do incredible damage to you. Each single missile still does about 13 damage. Now, what's 13 damage to a Drake? Since these Guristas feature an enormous range there are more than 10 enemies firing at you. And these are not some easy pickings but Dire Infernos and other elite models.<br />
In the end I decided to leave this mission since I couldn't kill more than 1 ship in the heavy elite waves before fleeing - with 90% resistance to their missile damage.<br />
<br />
If you decide to do this mission I strongly recommend help from another player. Staying out of range of their missiles is near-impossible since elite Guristas are pretty fast, so some normal Drake with afterburners cannot escape their missile range.<br />
<br />
Do not even think about melee weapons. Seriously, the most imbalanced mission I aquired, given the laughable LPs compared to the extreme effort needed.

<span id="comment_2860"></span>I've tried blitz tactic suggested by TontoAuri. Killed triggers in Initial, First and Second Waves. Had to kill 4 Pithatis Enforcers before Fourth Wave appeared, which included not one but four Pithatis Death Dealers. Killing third one completed the mission.<br />
DO NOT ATTEMPT BLITZ unless you have a VERY STRONG tank! I used T2 fitted  Drake (except for launchers) with 643 shield defence (EFT10) and had to warp out twice. <br />
A command ship would work the best, I think.

Took me about 20 minutes in a drake, would have been much quicker if I was paying attention; barely scratched the paintwork.

<span id="comment_2915"></span>it is possible to do this mission in a Drake with low skills. If you are careful about the triggers, and use resists correctly, it can be a very straightforward mission.<br />
<br />
I accidently killed the first trigger, and the DPS from 12+ BC's was a little bit much, and I had to warp in and out a few times

<div class="comment">
<span id="comment_3603"></span>I have to agree with those here who say the mission can put some nice DPS - but only when you a) trigger all spawns without killing anything else and b) once they really all hit you. To kill the triggers you will need great range and to just stay in the middle you will need a tough tank. If you do this mission with a ship with less targetting and fighting range than ~110 km you will kill closer ships anyway in the meantime. <br />
<br />
I did this mission in a Tengu and was able to trigger all but the last spawn immediately, had to wait for the last since the trigger was starting at ~130km. I had no trouble tanking all even when they came close (all ships besides the killed triggers in their optimal range - did this for test). Structures didnt give me any loot at all.<br />
<br />
One important note - this mission allows you to warp-in whereever you want to, if you got a bm. Apart from that, you can also warp inside the mission, if you got a spot far enough out ... ;)<br />
<br />
Overall bounties are ~6 mil which i normally will get in one payout-intervall using the Tengu (which is ofc way too strong to be used in l3s).

<span id="comment_3621"></span>I was well-equipped and I regretted having tried it solo. I guess anytime 162 T2 Cruise missiles (6 launchers stacked) won't kill one average rat you know you ain't got a chance. Had three Dread Gurista BCS on and might as well be throwing snowballs. Game was only giving me` 200-odd damage per volley. Maybe a bug but it sunk me.

<span id="comment_3794"></span>I just finished this in an Abaddon, other then usual pushing s**t uphill, this wasn't an entirely difficult mission. Took a long time due to my very very slow BS. <br />
<br />
Interestingly I found only the first 3 Dire Cruiser class guys slow to drop, then the spawns seemed to scale down not up.<br />
<br />
85.03% kin resist<br />
45% therm resist<br />
<br />
P.S. I highly recommend have 5x Vespa II and 5x Hornet II if you can fit them both, otherwise just the Hornets (the Dire Frigates are a real pain.)

Full room aggro nearly broke the tank of my Drake, but then I &quot;only&quot; have 2 LSEs and a CDFP rig, 4 Ballistic Controls in the lows, no Shield Rechargers ... better target management on my part would have sorted that out.

<span id="comment_7816"></span>3rd spawn names are different, trigger changes mission to mission, got 6 rounds of jamming from 4th wave so have your drones at the ready.

<span id="comment_7913"></span>Spawns are a bit different that what's on this page, unknown if random or just old info.  Last two spawns for me did not contain specified trigger, rather the last non-elite cruiser was trigger in the third wave.  Third wave contained no Assassin/Assaulter and fourth wave contained only 3 elite jamming frigs and multiple Death Dealers.

<span id="comment_8141"></span>Ground through this in a passive Shield Tanked Drake - was never below around 50% shields.  It seems the trigger is just the last ship standing in each wave now.  I didn't try to figure out the highest bounty, and never got the next wave before the last was fully cleared.
