<br />
<br />
<h3>Pocket 2</h3>

Acceleration gate is <strong>not locked</strong> and 29 KM away from warp-in.<br />
<br />
<h4>Group (Auto-aggro): (45-60 KM)</h4>

<br />
Last ship or battleship killed spawns final group.  Note: Spawn group may aggro drones. Pull your drones in before triggering it. <br />
<br />
<h4>Spawn 1 (Auto-aggro): (35 KM)</h4>

4x Battleship (Pith Eliminator/Pith Extinguisher) (<strong>Eliminator: Heavy Jamming</strong>)<br />

4x Battlecruiser (Corelatis Squad Leader/Wing Leader)<br />
4x Battleship (Core Baron/Commodore)<br />
<br />
Despite Anire Scarlet's 5 million ISK bounty and being <strong>mission completion trigger</strong>, she is no better tanked than any battlecruiser and is very easy to kill. 0-2 T1 modules in her wreck, nothing special. <br />
<br />
Last ship killed spawns next group. Again, spawns may target drones. Keep close watch on them; they trend to go after the sentry turrets if left on auto. <br />
<br />
<h4>Spawn 1(above Scarlet's Sation)</h4>

4x Battleship (Corpus Oracle/Apostle)<br />
<strong><span class="underline">OR</span></strong><br />
4x Battleship (Core Port Admiral/Rear Admiral)<br />

<em>If Group 1 contains Guristas you will get Blood Raider, if Angels then you will get Serpentis.</em><br />
<br />
<h4>Spawn 2</h4>

5 x Battleship (Corpus Cardinal/Patriarch)<br />
<strong><span class="underline">OR</span></strong><br />
5 x Battleship (Core Grand Admiral/High Admiral)<br />
<em>Spawn's types will match those received in Spawn 1. Spawn 2 does a ton of incoming damage (compared to all previous spawns in this mission), so be full on cap and hp before triggering it.</em><br />
<br />
Scarlet's Station is extremely well-tanked (~500,000 HP) and has at least a chance to drop ammo.<br />
<br />
<strong>Final notes:</strong> It appears there is either two or more specific versions of the race combinations for this mission. One person reports a primary mixture of Blood Raider/Gurista, while I mostly encountered Serpentis/Gurista (never saw a Blood Raider). While I tried to add his non-detailed findings to this page, most of this applies to the version I received. While this mission can be done solo in a Drake (this is what I used) or a Scorpion Navy Issue (used by Roper), be prepared to <strong>omni tank</strong> and bring along <strong>omni damage</strong> if you can; you <strong>will</strong> be fighting a mixture of Angel, Blood Raider, Gurista, and Serpentis.<br />
<br />
<strong>for Mission farmers</strong>  In the last room, either FOF missiles or drones, if used because of jamming from Gurista Nullifers, will kill Scarlet; thus completing the mission.<br />
<br />
<h3>Blitz</h3>

You will get this mission a lot. Make sure you always keep one Gate Key for future use; it will not be consumed. Pocket 1 is the only locked gate. <br />
<br />
My advice is to use an afterburner, gun through each pocket, and pop maybe one high value BS per pocket. Pop Anire in the last pocket for 5mil, and head home. That's 10-11mil for maybe 15 minutes' work.<br />
<br />
<h3>Mining</h3>

8 Veldspar asteroids pocket 1<br />
<br />
<h3>Bounty</h3>

Mission Reward + Bonus ~ 3.4 Mil<br />
Bounty ~ 29 Mil<br />

<span id="comment_6422"></span>I've found little to no information on this mission so I thought I'd add my somewhat poor notes to get things started and help a bit if possible.<br />
<br />
first of all you will meet Angels, Guristas, Serpentis, and Blood Raiders. So, an Omni tank and lots of ammo are required. <br />
I flew this mission in a Scorpion Navy issue with Large booster, 2x booster amps, 1 Kin, 1 Exp, and 1 therm hardener and 1 invul field. all T2. The extra mid slot was a target painter. I had no problems tanking the mission, but I think less of a tank would have had to bail. My Raven Navy would surely have had to lose the target painter to make it. If I were to get this mission again I may swap the therm for another invul as there is more EM dmg than I anticipated. <br />
initially you warp to a guarded gate. There is a group of cruisers and BS's there, the last of which drops a gate key. The group I got initially was Serpentis. 4x cruisers and 5x BS's. After they were cleared I was over 70km from the gate key container so I warped out and back to get closer. Upon which a similar group of Angels spawned. As far as I can tell warping out causes the respawn. There were also 4x cruisers and 5x BS's. After they were down I picked up both keys and jumped through. Neither key was consumed.<br />
In the second pocket I found a group of Blood raiders. Also cruisers and BS's.<br />
In the third pocket, there were 3x serpentis frigates and 4x guristas BS's. The last BS killed spawned another 4x guristas BS's.<br />
In the fourth pocket you find the mission objective, who has been jumping ahead as you progress. I killed her first and got a mission complete. Additionally there are Blood Raider and Guristas cruisers and BS's, in addition to 1ea. Angel, Guristas, Serpentis, and Blood heavy and cruise missile batteries. After all these are cleared another spawn of 4x Blood BS's appeared and after that I got another 4x Blood BS's. <br />
...and that was all. <br />
Overall a very cool mission with over 36 mil isk bounties. With loot and salvage I made over 50 mil.<br />
hugs and kisses, Roper

<span id="comment_6450"></span>I got full aggro on the last room after warp-in, was jammed for about 6-7m (Golem sensor strength didn't help I suppose) while being scrammed by 2 frigates. I had 1xInvul II and 1xPhoton Scattering II, Marauders 3x, Gist B-Type X-Large shield booster+Shield Boost Amp II and 5 crystal implants (all but Omega). I didn't freak out much, but if I were on a Tech 2 fitted Raven, things might not have ended up well. After killing the 2 jamming cruisers (Moa hulls), thing were a little better.<br />
For the last spawn of BSes I was running very low on cap and my shields were down to 40% ish<br />
It was the first time I got this mission, so I'm guessing it's related to standings (I got back to 10.0 with my agent/Caldari Navy after dropping to 9.7 after failing a mission).<br />
Anyway, do come prepared and if you are not used to hard rooms (Angel Extravaganza Bonus), think twice (or just try to blitz the last room). It was also the first time I saw Jamming/Scramming on a mission.<br />
Loot/Salvage/Bounties are on par with similar 40-50m long missions. <br />
<br />
As for the factions spawns:<br />
- 1st room: Angel Cartel<br />
- 2nd room: Serpentis then Guristas<br />
- 3rd room: Serpentis then Blood Angels<br />
- 4th room: Guristas, Blood Angels and Blood Angels

<span id="comment_6463"></span>Take care of ships following into the 2nd pocket.<br />
There might spawn one group for each ship that enters this pocket after the first activation of the locked gate.<br />
<br />
We entered with two BC, one group spawned.<br />
Afterwards two ships jumped in independently and two more groups spawned.<br />
<br />
It seems the locked gate can be used like the bonus stage in AE within the 10 seconds after the activation by the char with the gate key.<br />
<br />
Loot: 2630 m³

<span id="comment_6474"></span>I ran this mission in my Navy Scorp, it was a breeze except for the last room (where I encountered some target jammers).  But thankfully in the last room there appeared to be very little or no drone aggro (just because it didn't happen to me doesn't mean it's not possible i guess).<br />
<br />
This mission is CRAZY for bounties in ways AE never will be though.  I warped through all of the mission rooms 3-4 times because I wanted to test the spawns in every room to see exactly how it worked.  From what I could tell the Cruisers/battleships in room 1 will respawn any time there is not a ship actively in the room (my friend was coming to salvage the mission while i was going through it and I had barely left the first room before he got there and saw the spawns).<br />
  I didn't encounter any respawns after that until the last room where it respawned everything except the ECM group (thank god) and it was in chain form so it wasn't hard at all.  Three straight spawns of nothing but good bounties (might have been 4 actually I can't remember)<br />
<br />
My verdict on this mission is that if you can hold an omnitank and switch damage types on the fly (caldari missile boats rock for this) then this is the perfect mission to harvest isk.  In my little run through's combined with my friends salvage we made a total of 80mil in bout an hour.  Considering the respawns are all of the easy targets (mostly battleships worth 880k-1.2m) it makes this mission perfect for plowing over and over and over again.<br />
<br />
I have just now gotten this mission again and will post any new found results tomorrow.

<span id="comment_6477"></span>I've run this mission twice and the only problems that I've had is with jamming in the second pocket.  Even with 2x Backup Ladar Array II (which gives me 44 points of sensor strength) I have a hell of a time getting through the 3 Pithum Exterminators in that room.  It takes me as long to do that room as the rest of the mission does, as I'm nearly constantly jammed.  I'm not sure what else I can do to boost my sensor strength enough - I've also tried with Sensor Booster IIs to no effect.  <br />
<br />
Bounties do rock, in the range of 30M if you run it once - going to have to try the chain.

<div class="comment">
<span id="comment_6490"></span>Done with a Maelstrom. Pocket two is a pain with the Jamming. Needed to fit a 2 Ladar Backup Array II's and a Ladar ECCM to fend off the jamming. Could probably do it with 2 ECCM's and 1 backup Array but whatever gets the job done. I had 74.3 points of Ladar...was jammed only once when I was tagged teamed.<br />
<br />
If you plan to Solo this mission, plan for some ECM countermeasures in Room 2 or come equiped with heavy Drones...5 Hammerhead II's were not enough to take the Battleships down (I have decent drone skills, maybe maxed skills could do it)<br />
<br />
Everything else is a walk in the park. If you want to make some good money, leave Scarlet be in the last gate and replay this mission every day until the last day when it expires. Also warp out of pocket 1 and back in...sometimes you get another squadron of ships to kill. You can make 15 mil in the first pocket alone after salvaging, loot and bounties if you get both groups.<br />
<br />
One of the best money making LVL 4 missions I've encountered (second to Smash the Supplier mission which was worth 61 mil in bounties, loot &amp; salvage).

<span id="comment_6496"></span>I've done this mission twice now.  First time through the 4 pockets I drew Serpentis-&gt;Guristas-&gt;Guristas-&gt;BloodRaiders+Guristas.  Second time I drew Angels-&gt;Guristas-&gt;Guristas-&gt;BloodRaiders+Angels.  <br />
<br />
Omni tanked my CNR as follows:<br />
<br />
Mids<br />
==== <br />
Invuln II<br />
Photon II<br />
Ballistic II<br />
Heat II<br />
CN Boost Amp<br />
CN X-Large Booster<br />
<br />
Lows<br />
====<br />
DC II<br />
Gravimetric Backup Array II<br />
CN BCS x 3<br />
<br />
You get 70% omni resists with the above tank, plus some anti-jam for the Guristas.<br />

Bounties: 30m+<br />
Rewards+Salvage: ~7m

<div class="comment">
<span id="comment_6500"></span>OK, so this is how it went down for my first run through this very odd mission.  <br />
<br />
I fly a machariel.  My alt normally follows closely in a noctis for clean up after I've cleared a room, or taken all the agro.  He also flies a cane with a warfare link and he has some pretty decent boosts if I feel I need some backup.  Just in case the ECM in room 2 was too annoying I got him to bring his cane.  <br />
<br />
I mopped up the first room, grabbed the key, warped out and back in to get the second spawn and then brought in my alt so he could grab the second key.  How thoughtful of of the mission designer to make 2 keys available for me to use instead of having to buy one.  I went into room 2 to get the agro and targeted the battleships and alpha'd the first locked target before I realized I saw only blood raiders; no guristas and therefore no ecm.  I guess when I read the mission report for room 2 all I saw was &quot;Guirsta&quot; and &quot;ECM&quot;, but I checked and sure enough it does say Blood/Guirista.  I proceeded to take down the next couple of battleships while my alt followed me in.  At the exact moment my alt showed up in the room, what was left of the blood raiders (all the BC's and 1 BS) disappeared and guristas showed up in their place!  I only had 1 cycle worth of ECM, so it was easy enough to kill the aledged jammer battleships.<br />
<br />
After dealing with the jammers, my alt went back for his noctis to start salvaging room 1 while I finished cleaning up room 2.  I activated the gate to room 3 and then had my noctis flying alt warp to me (I didn't bookmark room 1, why would I?).  So as I was blowing up ships in room 3, my alt was cleaning up what I had though was room 1, although for some reason it seemed there weren't enough wrecks.  He was done cleaning up before I was done making the mess in room 3 so I had him activate the gate I thought was leading to room 2!  He warped into room 3 which I was still working on.  The re-spawn had just appeared at about the same time, and they agro'd my poorly tanked alt's noctis instead of my supremely well tanked machariel, so I warped him out.  I killed the spawn, and when I warped my alt to me, he came directly to room 3 and not the initial gate as is normal for any other mission!!!!  <br />
<br />
This is very odd behavior.  After clearing up the final room, I warped away and then back to the first room of the mission.  After my alt cleaned up the wreckage in the final room I tried something that shouldn't be possible.  He warped directly to me!  In other-words, directly from the last room to the first room!  That can't happen in any other mission as far as I know.  So basically the rooms are not treated like deadspace pockets, and you can warp directly to any room you like if you have a fleet member there to warp to, or a bookmark for the room!

<div class="comment">
<span id="comment_6504"></span>since my last post I've run this mission 3 or 4 times and every single time has been very different.  something to look out for though for sure would be when the gurista group spawns in room 2.  If they are the ones there you should prepare to be ECM'd hardcore.<br />
  In my Navy scorp I was quite literally in that room being ECM'd almost constantly for a half an hour (I'm too lazy to go get F.O.F's and thats about how long it takes for drones to mop up the small stuff and getting in a lucky cruise missile here and there).<br />
  One good thing I noticed was that there was no drone aggro, so if you got a good tank don't panic.<br />
  Would definitely suggest taking out those battleships first though, if you can even get rid of of one before the ECM starts then it won't be as bad and less likely to chain up.

4 x Corpum Arch Sage cruiser<br />
4 x Corpus Cardinal battleship<br />
<br />
In room 3:<br />
2 x Corelior Artillery Serpentis destroyer<br />
1 x Corelior Cannoneer Serpentis destroyer<br />
3 x Pith Massacrer<br />

3 x Pith Extinguisher<br />
1 x Pith Eliminator<br />

Jamming was far less than the first time I did this.

<span id="comment_6506"></span>I did both Dread Pirate Scarlets for the same Caldari corporation. It's possible that the majority NPC in the mission is dependent on which faction you do the mission for (both times I did it, despite the variation of exact spawns, it was overwhelmingly Serpentis/Guristas I fought), but there is no exact set of spawns.<br />
<br />
Again: the spawns seem to always vary.

<span id="comment_6507"></span>One last thing to add, both times I've done this mission I haven't gotten an implant container or implant. Both times the named battlecruiser, Adire, had no loot. Perhaps this is one of those missions with a very low chance of Adire dropping an implant container/implant loot?

<span id="comment_6518"></span>You can warp directly to any pocket where you've dropped a bookmark. So if you need to warp out to change shields to match the enemy (which changed in the two times I've run this so far), you don't need to go back through all the gates. In my CNR, I came back 100 km from the bookmark and sniped them from long distance.

<span id="comment_6586"></span>There is a 3rd spawn in the final pocket, probably upon warp out, I've run the mission several times and seen this... I've found the respawns in general make full salvage of this mission a nuisance unless you have a Marauder. You could fit salvage gear to something else I guess but really not ideal given the ~15-20km distance to each gate, you want a proper salvage rig... so while the bounty is good on this mission it can be time inefficient, dealing with respawns, warps and occasionally forgetting the stupid gate key!

Best idea as said is to stick your nose in each pocket, save a bookmark, dock back in station, get rat specific tank, go back. This doesn't work in all pockets (some like pocket 1 and 4 just summon random rats each time you warp in, so you have to omni tank there or warp back and forth until your tank matches the rats).

The option to warp straight to BM's is still there. (or to a ship in another room).<br />
The re-spawning of room 1 (when you exit then warp in again) appears to have gone. So no more farming :(<br />
EDIT: when farming room 1, make sure all ships have left the mission. also, you may have to wait 90 seconds for it to trigger. This might work.<br />
Room 1 has a glitch (still) when another ship warps in; all the existing NPC'S disappeared and a completely new spawn took its place, despite the first group and I mutually shooting at the time! <br />
So, still a wierd mission with at least 1 glitch

<span id="comment_6756"></span>Normally I have refused this mission. But I have gotten it 4 times in a row from 4 agents. 2 caldari agents in the same station. So it's been a while since I tried to solo a new lvl4 to add to the list of doable missions. So I risked my Navy Megathron. This mission turned out to be moderately easy but very time consuming waiting for the sensor jammers to cycle down. I used T1 Wasps, 425mm prototype guass guns, large armor rep, passive armor hardeners. One for all resistances and one of each dmg type except em. The rest was Mag Stabs.   I believe in the mission report it said you get the implant if you kill her in room 3. I only got 2 shots off before she warped. If I would have gotten one more off, I would have gotten the implant I guess. Killing her in the last room, I didn't get the implant.

On occasion, I'll get Serpentis Destroyers + Blood BSs in room 3.  When this happens and I warp-in my salvager (after combat), it'll trigger the Serpentis/Guristas spawns in room 3.  This pattern will also follow in room 4.<br />

I was able to pick off the cruisers as I flew to the gates (already had a gate key for the first gate). Hit Scarlet first to get her to warp out.

WARNING: If you warp out, the packs will respawn and potentially be different than the ones you encountered before. This is especially aggravating with the Gurista pack that has 3x jamming battleships.

You really never know what you will get, 2 of my mates and I made about 74mil(bounties) once from respawns, but only once. 2. It is a great farming mish, would love more respawns and do this mish all day long...lol. But today I leave this comment because I lost my Noctis in this mish. I recommend that u always have a guard with you when u salvage in a noctis. I made sure to clear everyroom twice at least, meaning I flew through the whole mission twice. Wen and grabbed me noctis, salvaged all the first 3 rooms. Got to the last room and there was a spawn, they locked me b4 i could get out and warp scrammed my ship. Well I obviously lost it..sad day! So becareful...this mish is full of suprizes, and the spawn was only cruisers and frigs no bs's.

<span id="comment_7809"></span>Ok, from my last post i did more then 15-20 missions and i can confirm - in case you get &quot;Gurista: Exterminator&quot; in 2nd pocket you MUST use FoF missiles. Not sure what advice to give for turret ships but if you use missiles then for your sake take FoF missiles and be done in few min. Jamming is extremely high and if you dont have alternative way to kill them skip this pocket or you will easily stuck for 20-30+ min. Dont bother to come with 2 ships as the chance to get perma jammed on both ships is almost 100%.

<br />
I haven't tested using a Warp Disruptor on Anire Scarlet in Pocket 3, as she usually disappears too quickly.<br />
<br />
If anyone has used a Warp Disruptor to good effect, can you describe the exact steps or link a demonstration video, please?

<span id="comment_7845"></span>Ran this mission post rubicon:<br />
No jamming ships whatsoever<br />
No respawn when re-warping into the rooms<br />
No loot whasoever in ANY of the structures<br />
Loot totalled [modules=841m3 13mill est] [salvage 3.1m3 8.8mill est]<br />
Bounties came to about 30mill in total<br />
Very crappy quality loot and overall a very time consuming mission

<span id="comment_7966"></span>Got this mission; no group respawns on any of the rooms after warp out/in. Also, scarlet would warp out of both room 2 and 3 within 5 seconds. Overall, a long, easy mission with a sniper Domi; only trouble i had was in room 3 due to the gurista missile boats, only thing that had the range to get to me (plus i had no wardens so i had to hit them with bouncers).

<span id="comment_8126"></span>For blitz I tried to fit a point.<br />
It worked.<br />
In the second pocket ( where she is about 30km from you), i overloaded a point and caught her at 24+ km.<br />
I even got a popup message that i caught her and that i should finnish her off now.<br />
When i killed the pirate a can with social adaptation chip basic dropped.<br />
I think this mission is intended for using a warp disruptor and kill her before last pocket.

<span id="comment_8318"></span>I had the first three pockets respawn on me this afternoon. I started the mission before work but could not complete pocket #4.. Came home, warped to mission again, and as I approached the warp gate, they respawned! Seems the timer still exists, but must be hours. The loot was almost non-existent the second time through though.

<span id="comment_8357"></span>First time I recall doing this missions. Station dropped absolutely nothing, not even a can with a single metal scrap. Pathetic. <br />
Anire Scarlet dropped normal cruiser loot (in other words, junk).<br />
<br />
Can NOT fly directly to a member in a pocket. Tried repeatedly. Had to warp the toon with the gate key out, warp back with my salvager toon to the first room, both activate gate within a few seconds of each other (gate key holder first of course) and then slow boat to the each gate after that. Once though the gate between the 1st and 2nd rooms the rest were unlocked.

<span id="comment_8359"></span>2nd time I've done this one now and again, the station didn't drop a single thing and Anire Scarlett only had a single metal scrap and a meta 1 mod.<br />
<br />
But the bounties add up to near 30 mil plus the 2 mil for the mission and bonus, and another 15.3 mil in scraps/loot.<br />
(This time our salvager had his own gate key so we didn't have any issues moving from room to room.)

<span id="comment_8391"></span>Confirmed. Normal space warp into other pockets is no longer possible. Probably removed with anti-farming change in 2014. Intentionally making it hard to salvage with second toon while mission is ongoing. <br />
<br />
In fact without a key card for each fleet member you must complete mission solo. Unless there is a 10 second open window like for rat tag keys to Extravangza bonus rooms. Didn't try that so IDK. <br />
<br />
So make sure to BM each room for later salvage. Or swap to salvage ship while mission is ongoing (horribly inefficient due to gate travel distances).
