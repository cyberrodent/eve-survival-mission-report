<h2>Epic Arc Overview</h2>

<strong>Agent Name:</strong> Hiva Shesheva<br />
<strong>Agent Corporation:</strong> Krusual Tribe<br />
<strong>Agent Location:</strong> Tanoo System at Krusual Mobile Library (Celestial Beacon)<br />
<strong>Additional Requirements:</strong> Hacking III and Archaeology III (skill), Data Analyzer and Relic Analyzer (module)<br />
<strong>Note:</strong> You can use the mobile depot to refit on-site for a data/relic module. Also very useful an Emergent Locus Analyzer subsystem if you are using a T3.<br />
<br />
<br />
<strong>Important note:</strong><br />
<div class="indent">* Your standing is only checked by the starter agent. After starting the epic arc, subsequent agents will not check standings.<br />
* This means while running the epic arc, you can continue doing missions even if your standing drops below +5.00 yet remains above -2.00 Faction standing.</div>

<h3><span class="underline">Mission 1</span> - Church Of The Obsidian</h3>

Faction: Amarr<br />
Mission Type: Encounter<br />
Space Type: Gated Deadspace (MWD works)<br />
Web/Scram: Ammatar Navy Delta I, Ammatar Navy Gamma II<br />
Required: Archeology III and Relic Analyzer module<br />
<br />
Mission Objective:<br />
<ul><li> Retrieve 1x Blood Obsidian Orb (0.1 m3) and return to Agent.</li></ul>
<br />
<strong><span class="underline">Warning</span></strong><br />
<ul><li> Destroying these ships will incur a small Faction Standing loss to Amarr Empire.</li></ul>
<br />
<strong><span class="underline">Note</span></strong><br />
<ul><li> Ships are actually Ammatar but Amarr Empire Faction will incur the negative standing hit for any Ship Kill/Aggro.
</li><li> Destroying these ships is not required to complete mission. 
</li><li> If needed destroy any scram Frigates and warp away.</li></ul>
<br />
<h5>At Gate (25-50km)</h5>

(No aggro until within 15km of gate)<br />
7x Frigate (Ammatar Navy Delta I, Ammatar Navy Gamma II, Ammatar Navy Soldier) <strong>Web/Scram</strong><br />
3x Battleship (Ammatar Navy Armageddon, Ammatar Navy Apocalypse)<br />
<br />
<h5>Pocket 1 (30-40km)</h5>

5x Frigate (Ammatar Navy Soldier)<br />
5x Cruiser (Ammatar Navy Maller)<br />
10x Battleship (Ammatar Navy Armageddon, Ammatar Navy Apocalypse)<br />
<br />
<strong><span class="underline">Tips</span></strong><br />
<ul><li> Apocalypse Battleships use short range weapons and will quickly close in to 6km range.
</li><li> Mission completed when 1x Blood Obsidian Orb (0.1 m3) is removed from container.
</li><li> 2,461,000 units of Veldspar within a radius of 15km.</li></ul>
<br />
<div class="indent"></div>
<strong><span class="underline">Tips</span></strong> (Avoid Negative Standing Hit For Ship Kill)<br />
<ul><li> At Gate area, lure NPC's away at least 150km and then quickly double back to access Gate.
</li><li> Apply same strategy inside Pocket 1, lure NPC's away from the Chapel at least 150km, then double back and hack container. 
</li><li> Fitting a Micro Jump Drive will help a lot.</li></ul>
<br />
<strong><span class="underline">Blitz</span></strong><br />
<ul><li> Have a Tengu with heavy tank fitted with Emergent Locus subsystem. Try and break through the gate. At pocket 1, Lure them out to about 70km. Warp out and back in through the gate, deal with frigates. Burn to the relic and hack it. Warp Out.
</li><li> If not using a Tengu, it is always faster to chop through their DPS until you can perma-tank it. Refit the analyzer with a mobile depot, hack and loot. Unless of course you dont want ANY faction loss.</li></ul>

<strong><span class="underline">Note</span></strong><br />
<ul><li> All 3 original Relics must be hacked with Relic Analyzer.

<span id="comment_5301"></span>The standings reward is always going to be 6.25% (unless CCP changes things), but keep in mind that this 6.25% is going to vary in *effectiveness* according to your present standing...in my case, I selected Mission 5b and my Minmatar went from 5.68 to 5.95. But my standings log does say that that is 6.25%.

<span id="comment_5400"></span>I avoided killing the ships that are mentioned as giving the negative standings hits, but I got Amarr and Ammatar hits anyways from killing different ships. So is probably no way to kill the ships without a corresponding standings loss. In my case, the loss was very small...-0.018% to Amarr.

<span id="comment_5401"></span>For players who are going for the standings rewards: According to the info I am getting, the completion of 5A will give 11.5% Minmatar faction (not Gallente as the path-name implies). Completion of 5B gives 6.25% Minmatar, as previously stated. (Some players are saying they got 12% or 12.5% for 5A. I don't know whats going on. Sliding scale perhaps?)

If you dont like the idea of getting jumped because you use a long range setup instead of close, deliver the datacore with a shuttle &amp; then come back in with your mission boat - worked for me.

<span id="comment_6476"></span>mission 4: Stillwater... The energy neut is the pain here. a passive tank rattlesnake might be nice. Karkoti Rend, who holds the mission objective, and a 10 mil bounty, is pretty easy to kill if you can tank the room long enough without your cap running dry. <br />
Afterwards I went for the Retraction ending and only got 6.0% standing increase.

<span id="comment_6917"></span>Standings increases make sense, now that I read the evelopedia. The base standings increases are either 10.0% (if you did mission 5a) or 5.0% (if you did mission 5b). These will be modified by your Social skill. At Social V, the increases will be 12.5% and 6.25% respectively.

<span id="comment_6918"></span>Missions 1 and 2 will cause Amarr and/or Ammatar standings hits if you shoot npcs. Here is how me and my alts avoided these hits:<br />

Mission 1: Tanked gate with drake/basilisk combo. No gate npc had scramblers.<br />
         : Second drake warped in and immediately ran away (lol). His AB speed<br />
           of 389m/s was enough to pull ahead of the pocket frigs and stay out<br />
           of range of any webs/scrams. Only took a few seconds for the<br />
           entire pocket to agro him.<br />
         : Third drake, equiped with Analyzer, warped into pocket and AB to<br />
           the can.<br />
<br />
Mission 2: Tanked all spawns with drake/basilisk combo. There are no<br />
           scramblers.<br />

<span id="comment_6940"></span>Missions 1-3 of this are all fairly easy. I took out my shield booster and replaced it with the analyser for mission 2 and could have done the same for mission 1 too.<br />
<br />
Mission 4 - if you can gank well at &lt;45km range is not as hard as it seems. You arrive at about 40km from the neut tower. I was set up to run and fight 175km away but the tower died before locking me and destroying cap. After that, although it's a tough old fight it's no harder than a typical tough L4 mission.

The other character completed and didn't share the faction for 11.5% standings increase to Minmatar (both characters are at lv3 in their relevant social skills).<br />

I only shot the frigs and cruisers and only in pocket 1, and still got 1 Amarr standing hit for -0.018, so it's not just the geddon and apoch.<br />

In Mission 2 - Heresiology<br />
<br />
I only shot the frigs and cruisers I lost -3.0% for a ship kill to Ammatar Mandate, which really sucks for those wanting good standings everywhere. <br />
<br />
For those that hate the new clickfest from the hacking mini game, you can just fail each hack quickly to get to the drop, as there is no loot to gain from the hacking portion of this mission.

<span id="comment_8139"></span>Mission 1 - Church of the Obsidian - it's not possible to warp around, so trick with luring the NPCs away using warp jumps around the grid doesn't work. MJD around and back to the church works tho (no need to kill anything).<br />
<br />
Mission 2 - Heresiology the Ammatar faction -3.0% hit is for killing the detectives. -0.075% for killing the Delta Support I frigs. No standing hit for killing just the cruisers and battleships.

Tactics are to hack the can for as long as the tank lasts or until you finish hacking the cluster of cans, then MJD out, use the AB to burn to 100km off the next thing you want to hack, let the MJD timer expire and rep your tank back up and let your cap refill enough, then MJD back to the next can, rinse, repeat. Y<br />
<br />
You will pull the rats all over the shop and the only ones that are really a bother are the webbing frigs which make getting to cans to hack/open them a pain.<br />
<br />
I did not find loot in any of the cans except the last one with the mission item.<br />

The highs are irrelavant, and the bling is probably unecessary, the sebo lets you keep the cans locked from 100km+ out.
