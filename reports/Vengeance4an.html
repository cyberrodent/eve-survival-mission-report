<h3>Pocket 1</h3>

You land right next to pretty much all the rats. The furthest ones are about 50km away while the closest ones as close as 15km. The rats are in four groups, of which the closest sometimes aggros, but sometimes you land far enough that you can aggro one at a time. Watch your drone hitpoints, they might gain aggro from nearby rats as they have to work in close proximity. The furthest group is the hardest to tank both in this room and the whole mission.<br />
<br />
<img src="./screenshots/Vengeance4an-1.jpg" alt="Room 1" title="Room 1" /><br />
<br />
<h4>Group 1: (10-25km) (Auto-Aggro)</h4>

3x Battlecruisers (Gistatis Primus/Tribuni)<br />
2x Battleships (Gist General)<br />
<br />
<h4>Group 2: (10km)</h4>

3x Battleships (Gist War General)<br />
<br />
<h4>Group 3: (20km)</h4>

7x Cruisers (Gistum Marauder/Liquidator)<br />
<br />
<h4>Group 4: (20-30km)</h4>

2x Elite Frigates (Angel Webifier/Viper) (Web/Scramble)<br />
2x Destroyers (Gistior Haunter)<br />
9x Cruisers (Gistum Centurion/Phalanx)<br />
2x Battleships (Gist War General/Nephilin)<br />
<br />
<h3>Pocket 2</h3>

Aggro from five battlecruisers at warp in. There are four groups total and each aggro seperately. Easy stage.<br />
<br />
<h4>Group 1: (5km) (Auto-Aggro)</h4>

5x Battlecruisers (Gistatis Legionnaire/Primus)<br />
<br />
<h4>Group 2: (25km)</h4>

3x Cruisers (Gistum Marauder/Liquidator)<br />
3x Battleships (Gist Saint/Warlord)<br />
<br />
<h4>Group 3: (30km)</h4>

<h4>Group 4: (35km)</h4>

3x Destroyers (Gistior Defacer)<br />
6x Cruisers (Gistum Centurion/Phalanx)<br />
1x Battleship (Gist Nephilin)<br />
<br />
<h3>Pocket 3</h3>

Aggro from one battleship, two battlecruisers and one destroyer at warp in. Firing on any of the rest aggros all.<br />
<br />
<h4>Group 1: (2km) (Auto-Aggro)</h4>

1x Destroyer (Gistior Seizer)<br />
2x Cruiser (Gistum Marauder)<br />
1x Battleship (Gist Commander)<br />
<br />
<h4>Group 2: (50km)</h4>

5x Elite Frigates (Angel Webifier/Viper) (Web/Scramble)<br />

<br />
<h4>Group 3: (60km)</h4>

2x Tower Sentry Angel III<br />
2x Angel Heavy Missile Battery<br />
<br />
Kill Hoborak Moon and the mission is complete. Battlestation in the final room drops worthless loot, mostly ammo.<br />
<br />
<h3>Note</h3>

Moon may drop stuff of the value of 2mil isk.<br />
The BS/C are tanked well, and moon is the hardest to take down.<br />
This mission is somewhat easy, but it may take 30 minutes for the perfect ship. But consider it an hour and half to 2 hours. <br />
This is a perfect mission to farm<br />
You may get 20mil in bounties<br />
<br />
<strong>Blitz</strong> No real blitz must clear first 2 pockets to proceed into 3rd room<br />

<span id="comment_199"></span>Because of his defender use (like 3 at a time), I could not kill Hoborak Moon at range in a drake with scourge or havocs.  I tried to close range, but he didn't stop running until we reached about 180km away from the warp in spot, and then he turned around and stopped.  I was then able to pop him.<br />
<br />
I filled out the rat list properly as well.

<span id="comment_270"></span>I originally did this in a drake, which took quite a few shots per battleship to take down.  I went back in a domi, and I think it took longer with sentries, so I wouldn't pull aggro from the tightly grouped spawns.   If you can tank the first room with an omni tank, you should be fine though.  Most battleships orbit closely, but the officer stays around 56km away.

<span id="comment_869"></span>Hoborak Moon is easy to take out it took me some time though I had to warp out a few times cuz I didnt outfit my Raven w/ EM hardeners. When I did this mission I tried to drag Hoborak out into around where you warp in, then I warped back out. All you have to do is not target him and he'll fly back to the battlestation. Get a webifier and get in range then unleash your torpedoes.

<span id="comment_1779"></span>Ok, at the time I'm writing this I'm a 6.5m sp pilot.<br />
<br />
I flew this one and ofc has to completely change fittings at the end on hoborack.<br />
<br />
I fly a tanked domi and fit 5 dual250mm meta 4 railguns with web and used berzerker 1s to finish out the dmg.  It took forever and i had to change his direction by flying around him so he didnt get to edge of mission and fly back to start position.  Once i did that i webbed him and beat on his shields at about 7500m till he was gone.

<span id="comment_1793"></span>I run missions with dual rep Abaddon.  Done this mission twice:  first time I ran it, I refit for Hoborak with 2 SW-900 drones and an AB. Still took me a few minutes to catch him.  Second time, I destroyed station before refitting.  When I came back, Hoborak didn't run.  Verify station destruction keeps Hoborak from running.

<div class="comment">
<span id="comment_3947"></span>Zen's comment is not exactly accurate. Hoborak can be easily taken out in a webless AB Machariel. Just have to remember he has 8500 shield HP, which is about 40-50% more than most Angel BSes, hence him taking a little longer than other Angel BSes.<br />
<br />
T2 large AC Machariel does this mission in under 30 to 40 minutes. I've tested this myself multiple times.

<span id="comment_4187"></span>This mission took me 1hr 50m to complete in a Drake.  Very easy all the way until the end boss.  Here, I went back to the station and fitted an EM hardener (not actually required) an AB and a third Ballistic Control Unit.  My DPS was 343 after this and I still had a real struggle to break his tank.  I circled Hoborak at 5000m and it took exactly 70 volleys of Caldari Navy Scourge to down him.

<span id="comment_7221"></span>Pocket 1:<br />
There was no auto-aggro any of the times I warped into this pocket.<br />
<br />
Group 4 aggros as two separate groups. I wasn't able to figure out which ships were part of which group, but I'm certain they were not one group.<br />
<br />
The first time I aggroed a target from that &quot;group&quot;, it aggroed all of them. After warping out and back, I got no auto-aggro. I fired upon another target and this time only aggroed about half of them. I shot at these half and moved through the cluster of rats and the other half continued to ignore me. I warped out and back again, and the same thing happened the third time.<br />
<br />
It would appear there are two groups amongst them, one which aggroes separately and one which aggroes the other one. But they sit next to each other and so appear to be one group.<br />
<br />
Pocket 2:<br />
Group 3 and Group 4 both had a Gist Malakim for me rather than a Gist Throne or Gist Nephilin. Group 4 also had 4 destroyers of two types (Gistior Haunter and Defacer I believe).<br />
<br />
Aggroing Group 4 caused Group 2 aggro (possible stage aggro, other Groups had been destroyed). Group 1 and Group 3 did aggro individually, though Group 3 has proximity aggro.<br />
<br />
Confirming that Groups 2, 3, and 4 do not auto-aggro.

The third I went in with arty Sleipnir and MJD to take out the web/cram frigates, and Hoborak Moon chewed me up into armor from 100+km.  I came back in PvP version of Claymore to finish him with HAMs It was mercifully quick with web and two neuts on him and Mjolnir rage.  My Mission Claymore could not make a dent in his tank.  My mission Sleipnir with Arty at close range also was ineffective.
