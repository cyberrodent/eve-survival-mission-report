<h3>Pocket Entrance</h3>

<br />
The warp gate into the pocket is guarded by a small group of ships. They will aggro immediately after you have warped in.<br />
You will need to eliminate all ships to unlock the gate. <br />

<br />
<h3>Single Pocket</h3>

<br />
Auto aggro from the initial group at warp-in.<br />
<br />
<h5><span class="underline">Warning</span></h5>

<ul><li> The incoming DPS is fairly heavy. Make sure your ship has a proper tank.</li></ul>

3x Battlecruisers (Centatis Wraith/Specter)<br />
1x Battleship (Centus Slave Lord/Plague Lord/Savage Lord)<br />
<br />
<h5>Tip</h5>

<ul><li> Primary targets are the webbing frigates. Eliminate them as quickly as possible using your drones (Snipe web towers if you transversal tank).
</li><li> Next eliminate the Cruise Missile batteries, battlecruisers and Heavy Missile batteries first, before you start on anything else.
</li><li> Heavy Missile Batteries can aggro multiple ships simultaneously.
</li><li> Better yet (if you have decent tank): Ignore everything but the two "Slaver" ships and kill only those and leave again, the frigates will not scramble usually.</li></ul>
<br />
<h5>Blitz</h5>

<ul><li> Pocket 1: The warp gate is locked. Clear the pocket before activating the warp gate.
</li><li> Pocket 2: Kill the two Sansha Slaver elite cruisers and warp out.</li></ul>
<br />
<h5>Mining</h5>

<br />
<ul><li> Pocket Entrance: 940K Veldspar, 250K Scordite</li></ul>

<span id="comment_286"></span>Need a good tank if you're flying a Caldari ship. Did it with some cap issues in a Raven by shooting the Cruise batteries and the the Heavy missile ones, then proceeding down the list, going from cruiser to the 2 mission objectives (I shot them last because they didn't seem to be doing a lot of damage.<br />
<br />
Drones were put on the scramming frigates on warp in (although I didn't get scrammed)<br />
<br />
Second time I did this was in a CNR with T2 hardeners (2XEM, 2XTherm). Very easy as long as you kill the cruise/heavy missile batteries asap.

<span id="comment_606"></span>Quite easy in a Typhoon due to good EM and therm base resistances of minnie ships.<br />
<br />
1 LAR, DC, 2x EM, 2x Therm (all T2) more than sufficient for tanking.

<span id="comment_735"></span>Usually I only get to kill 2-3 of the frigates before having to leave and try again. This time I went in with a Domi w/ 2x LAR, 3x EM Hardener, 1x Thermal Hardener and took out the cruise then heavy missile batteries first. It went pretty easily even with one of the frigates webbing me. I don't think the second LAR was wholly necessary though. Also, it turns out that the towers are primarily weak against thermal, while the ships are (as expected) primarily weak against EM.

<span id="comment_844"></span>With only 225dps at range, a sustained defense efficiency of 400 (Sansha profile: 55% EM / 45% Therm) was enough to easily complete the second room without warping (targetting Cruise batteries, then heavies first).

<div class="comment">
<span id="comment_865"></span>I had similar values like CasCaDego in my Drake, I had not to warp out either, but couldnt have stayed there forever - if I hadnt killed the cruises and heavies fast, it would have been time to leave since my shield was down to 30%. It recovered fast though after killing the launchers and sentries.

I was feeling lazy and didn't switch from omni resists.  Entrance pocket didn't scratch the tank; second pocket required both LARs and was still slowly breaking my tank.  Had plenty of time to reduce the incoming DPS though.

EM hardner, Thermal hardner, damage control, Large shield booster, and boost amp. Throw in a AB, and lots of autocannons. Easy<br />
<br />
The DPS is fairly heavy though, because even with 85% em, and 80% thermal resistances, the shield still drops slowly, but again, plenty of time to reduce the dps.

<span id="comment_1533"></span>If you are unsure about your tank for the Single Pocket of part two, then try this: After clearing the Pocket Entrance, jump into a noob ship and go through the gate. Bookmark where the gate lands you and warp away. Then use the bookmark to warp your missioning ship to within 100KM of the bookmark.

Was never scrammed. Armor never fell below 50%. First i took out the sentries/missiles, then the BS's, then the rest of them. Hobs II and Hammerheads II for the fast critters. No real problem with this setup.

<span id="comment_1697"></span>For the first mish, I got veld, and the second was indeed a mix of scord, veld, and omber.<br />
<br />
Also, the second room is easily doable in a Drake.  Take out the cruise missile batteries, (about 3 racks of Scourge) then the heavies (about 2 racks of scourge) then worry about the cruisers.  After that it's a piece of cake.  You might need to swap out for a higher DPS boat for the BS, though, (as with earlier BSs in this mission) as they have a _large_ armour rep amount, so it's more efficient to swap out.<br />
<br />
Also, Rachel Voegel's comment _needs_ to be added to the article.  Pocked 2 isn't deadspace.

<span id="comment_1815"></span>Did it in an omnitank Drake fit (1 EM, 2 Invuln, 3 LSE, 2 SPR). Tanked fine, shield never went below 60%. Also, I have done this mission a few times recently and I have yet to be scrambled by the frigs in the second part (only webbed). Took about 35 minutes for both parts.

<span id="comment_1955"></span>Looks like something changed recently : I just did this mission again, and in the first part you now warp directly on top of the &quot;Slave Pen&quot; (no more slowboating for 40 kms to &quot;loot&quot; the prisonners, yay !).<br />
<br />
Also, there were only 1 BS (Dark Lord), 2 BCs (Daemons) and 4 Frigates (3 Berzerkers, 1 Demon) in the initial spawn, but the amount of asteroids is still the same, and the &quot;Sansha Slaver&quot; BS still spawns after 10 minutes or so (didn't check my watch, but I had killed everything and wrote half this post before it spawned).<br />
<br />
I might add another comment if the second part has also changed ...

Frigs never scrambled, only webbed. Shoot Cruise Missile and Heavy Missile Turrets first, after that the incoming DPS is pathetic.

<br />
Part 2: I rushed through this so I could mine the omber. Added a Heavy SW-900 Webifier drone to the mix which let me instapop the little guys, The first room dished out boukup  dps (hit all the sentries and stasis towers first), easily tanked, although I used 2 800 boosters.<br />

<span id="comment_4683"></span>One can avoid a lot of damage in the second pocket by simply flying straight down until you're at about 45km from the batteries. Works great for a Drake w/ AB. Note that the batteries might target your drones if they get too close however.

<span id="comment_4948"></span>Part 1: (Which is really easy in a golem btw.) I warped in and killed all the rats, then for some reason I forgot to take the slave pen (prolly had the wrong overview setting) so I warped out of the system. Having realized this I warp back to the system and the missin to take the slave pen. A new Sansha Bs spawnd, 1.1 mill. <br />
<br />
 I didn't try this more times, but is this mission (part1) possible to farm by leaving the slave pen intact? Anyone who can elaborate?

The new Sansha BS that spawned is the Sansha Slaver. As stated above, it spawns roughly 10 minutes after the others. It does not spawn again after that, so that's a no as far as farming it.

Here's the rub- the sentry batteries in the second room of the second mission appear to have trained their multitasking skill.  I had redbox from every enemy in the room; but both my salvage fleet mate AND my drones (all five) were taking damage.  <br />
<br />
I wasn't using smartbombs, and my salvage fleety was &gt;30 kilometers away in any case.  Can anyone confirm?

All rats followed destroyed all frigates with about 60% of tank after that it was easy. I could control the engagement with distance. Only small part of Sentries started to fire me, none of stasis activated...<br />
Finished Cruisers and Battleship more than 100 km from towers so even these that actually shoot at me had minimal impact.

<span id="comment_7664"></span>In part 2, I did it in a very high resist, Pithum C boosted, 720 Artillery Sleipnir. Was webbed by everything that could web; the comment that the stasis tower range was about 15km was not the case. Did the towers first, starting with heavy missiles. Nothing targeted drones - 3x Hammerheads 2x hobs attacking web/scram frigates. Going from a comment above, I used Therm on towers, EM on the ships, which worked well. Glad I pushed my tank up (used a command link on a ship in-system but not with me and a DC) as it was sit and shoot until both frigs and both towers were down; glad or not, I was probably overtanked. All the ships went down reasonably fast.
