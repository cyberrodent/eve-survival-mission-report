<h1>Basic tips on setting up certain ships.</h1>

<br />
<h2>Disclaimer</h2>

<br />
I made this guide to answer a lot of common questions from people that just got their hands on different ships. I will however encourage people reading the forums, especially this forum post (out of game) as I will not go into detail, nor cover a lot of ships. I'm also considering the ships will be used in level 4 missions, solo. Use this as the basics to build up a ship you're comfortable flying.<br />
<br />
More specific setups can be found in <a class="ext" href="http://myeve.eve-online.com/ingameboard.asp?a=topic&amp;threadID=571635">this thread</a>.<br />
<br />
<h2>The setups</h2>

<br />
I tend to start with the tank first, and getting to know the ship that way. Then work on the main weapons and lastly fill the gaps for what the main weapons can't defeat. Usually you'll face everything from fast flying interceptors to hard tanking battleships.<br />
<br />
<h3>Raven</h3>

<br />
I'll start with the most used ship in eve. Most used for a reason. There isn't much to say about it. Just try to get a tank going, and then try to adjust the setup for your needs and skills.<br />
 <br />
<ul><li> High: 6x Cruise missile launchers, 1-2x heavy nos
</li><li> Med: 1x XL Shield booster, 1x shield boost amp, 3-4x hardeners (for the missing slot if using 3x hardeners: another x shield boost amp or 1x Cap recharger)
</li><li> Low: 2-3x Ballistic Control System, 2-3x Power Diagnostic Unit, 0-1x Damage Control
</li><li> Rigs: 2x Warhead Rigor Catalyst, 1x Capacitor Control Circuit
</li><li> Drones: 5x Medium, 5x small</li></ul>
<br />
<h3>Dominix</h3>

<br />
A ship that can be fitted in a myriad of ways. I started out with this. Then exchanged a lot of the parts when the tank held. Before investing in any expensive faction stuff, I recommend fitting at least 1 or 2x of the Auxiliary Nano Pump rig. There is no need for a webifier as the smaller drones will make short work of any interceptor attacking you.<br />
<div class="indent"><br />
</li><li> High: Nos + utility
</li><li> Med: 5x Cap rechargers
</li><li> Low: 2x Large Armor Repaiers, 3x hardeners, 1-2x Cap relays, 0-1x Energized adaptive nano membrane / Damage Control
</li><li> Rigs: 1-2x Auxillary Nano Pumps, 1-2x CCC
</li><li> Drones: 5x Small, 5x Medium, Rest Heavy.</div>
<br />
<h3>Ishtar</h3>

<br />
Though to fit this one. But it keeps flying even with named and t2 items.<br />
<br />
<ul><li>     * High: 2x Medium nos
</li><li>     * Med: 1x 10mn Afterburner, 3x Cap Rechargers, 1x Large Peroxide Battery
</li><li>     * Low: 1x Medium Armor Repairer, 1x Small Armor Repairer, 3x Armor Hardeners
</li><li>     * Rigs: Auxiliary Nano Pump
</li><li>     * Drones: 5x Light, rest heavy</li></ul>
<br />
<h3>Drake</h3>

<br />
There is a lot of ways to fit this. Never flown one myself, so I'm entering the setup submitted <a class="missingpage" href="./ZhouXi.html/edit" title="Create this page">ZhouXi</a>:<br />
<br />
<ul><li> High: 7x Heavy Missile Launchers II
</li><li> Med: 2x Large Shield Extender, 4x Damage Spesific Shield Amplifier IIs
</li><li> Low: 3x BCU II, 1x Beta Reactor Control: Shield Power Relay I
</li><li> Rigs: 3x Core Defence Field Purger I
</li><li> Drones: 5x light drones</li></ul>
<br />
If fighting drones or Mercenaries, the mid slots are changed to:<br />
2x Large Shield Extender IIs, 2x Invulnerability field IIs, 2x Shield Damage Amplifiers (Kin/Therm for mercenaries, EM/Therm for Drones)<br />
<br />
<h3>Typhoon</h3>

<br />
A ship that has to be fit to suit your fighting style, like other gunships.<br />
<br />
<ul><li> High: 4x 650mm artilleries, 4x Cruise Launchers
</li><li> Med: 4x Cap rechargers
</li><li> Low: 2x Large Armor repairers, 3x hardeners, 1x Energized Nano Membrane, 1x Cap Relay
</li><li> Rigs: 1x Capacitor Control Circuit, 2x Axillary Nano Pumps
</li><li> Drones: 5x small, rest heavy</li></ul>

I suggest:<br />
<br />

<br />
Swap a EANM for an Explo Hardner when needed

<span id="comment_130"></span>Don't forget the Nighthawk.  Once you get to level 5 missions, this ship gonna be your best friend.  It can tank much better than the Raven and puts out similar DPS (againt a Cruise Missile Raven) when using Scourge missiles.<br />

One of the other nice things about this setup: Swap the Shield Booster or one of the Large Shield Extenders for a Warp Disruptor and you're ready for PVP!

<span id="comment_151"></span>Your Domi's low slots and rigs need work. The correct Domi fit is 2 reppers, 4 hardeners(or 3 and an EANM for a few missions), 1 CPR, 1 CCC, and 2 Nano Pumps. It perma-runs just fine, tanks any L4 mission going, and you've even got the cap and fitting to spare for a track of medium guns to up your DPS pretty significantly, though I know some prefer 1 small laser(to draw aggro), 2 tractor, 2 salvager, and 1 drone range extender to avoid the need for coming back with a salvage ship. You'd have to be crazy to use a DCU, and the third rep amount rig is just wasteful.

<span id="comment_152"></span>&quot;The Correct Domi Fit&quot; :)<br />
<br />
It all depends on skills, opposing faction and not to forget, isk. I agree that the thirds rep rig is now not as effective as it was when I used the domi. It got a slight nerf after I fit all rig slots with that. But combined with a centus x-type lar it gives out an insane rep. amount. So I don't bother removing one of them.<br />
<br />
But again, that's why it's kinda wrong to say &quot;the correct setup&quot;. You can fit rep amount and rep duration rigs and then fill all the med slots with cap rechargers. Or you can fit CCC's instead and use the meds for ab and other things. The variations are endless.<br />
<br />
My point with the page originally was to sum up what people in lvl 4 had to say every time a newb joined.<br />
<br />
My recommendation is still to fit as many cap rechargers and relays as you can. Getting a decent running tank. Then drop one after another when you get better skills, better equipment (t1-&gt;good named-&gt;t2) and feel more confident with the ship and missions. If you manage to pull small groups all the time, and with the right tanking, you can survive certain mission without even repairing.<br />
<br />
An example is blockade vs blood raiders. I use a very expensive armor repairer and have one em and one therm hardener. Expensive ones those too. It's enough for that mission. I exchange a recharger for an ab, and fill the highs with electron blasters. In low I have one faction cap relay along the hardeners and 3x magnetic field stabs. That is of course with 3x repair amount rigs. The heavy drones finish off every non-bs class swiftly, even the interceptors, and with the aid of the electron blaster cannons, the battleships dies also fast. When I get into range that is. Only trouble is nos, but I always make those ships primary targets for my drones.<br />
<br />
Now. How much is my setup worth? Well, at least so much that I don't dare flying with it anymore due to the gankers. And not everyone can afford dishing out billions of isk for modules. So the key is to start at a level where your tank is holding and you'll survive most of the missions. Then you can go for improving your killing speed.

<span id="comment_155"></span>An other domi fit, just to point out that there is no &quot;best&quot;:<br />
<br />
high: rails (that fit after all others) for aggro and dmg, drone link aug for faraway targets<br />
med: cap re t2<br />
low: 2 LAR, 4 active hardener, 1 enam<br />
rigs: 3xCCC<br />
<br />
With some skills, this is a permarun, &quot;go-and-read-a-book&quot; setup for about all lvl4 misisons... or you can help your drones. And you don't depend on cap vampires or the like.

Does solid DPS, can tank like a champ.  The faction gear might be a bit pricey, but is well worth it.  If you add in a +5% CPU augmentation, you can drop one of the Flux Coils and put in another BCU.  A few other augmentations and you can get close to 500DPS out of it.

<br />
The mega provides less tank potential compared to a Dominix, with my skills and this setup it settles at around 500 dps tanked. The upside is your damage output will quickly offset the incoming damage, allowing you to tank any mission without problem, skill heavy boat nonetheless.

<span id="comment_1613"></span>An alternative for those not blessed with ISK and/or SP... I've used this setup very successfully on an industrial alt of mine (high SP, but not in combat skills!). Is very like a drake passive setup, however, it has a few advantages over the drake, in both range and drone capacity.<br />
<br />
Scorpion<br />
Hi: 4 x Arbalest Cruise Launcher, 2 x 250mm Railgun (or NOS + Drone link)<br />
Med: 3 x LSE II, 1 x Passive Shield Resistance Amp (rat specific), 1 x Active Shield Hardener (rat specific), 1 x Inv Field, 2 x Shield Recharger<br />
Low: 2 x Shield Power Relay II, 2 x Ballistic Control System II<br />
Rigs: 2 x Core Defence Field Purger, 1 x Anti-EM Screen<br />
<br />
Drones: usual mix to fill out 75m/3 (2xhvy, 2xmd, 1xlgt)<br />
<br />
Most of you will go, ugh!!!! wtf! but hey it does work.... although DPS isn't great the tank is pretty good, and it has over 100k range....

<span id="comment_6053"></span>If your running got guristas use eccm .. pref conjunctive ones .. the arent expensive / same racial specific strenght but lower activation cost .. so if you play around in your missions ship and you wanna be &quot;cap stable&quot; geting the diff from 20mins to n% are tweaks .. and one being replacing the eccm t2 with the conjunctive thats cheaper same attributes lower activation cost <br />
<br />
anywho you dont need cap stable missioning ships but .. if your like some of my friends that sometimes fall asleep when they mission after coming back form a hard day work .. its better to keep as safe as possible :))
