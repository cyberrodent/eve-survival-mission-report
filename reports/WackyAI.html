<h1>Wacky AI (1 of 2) Objectives</h1>

The following objectives must be completed to finish the mission:<br />
Bring Item Objective<br />
Acquire these goods: Drop-off Location	ZH3-BS<br />
Item	20 x Small Sealed Cargo Containers (200.0 m³)	<br />
Objective<br />
Destroy the drones guarding the storage bin, loot the sealed containers, and return them to Erakki Kihuo in one piece. Location	&#8722;0,2 ZJ-QOO (Low Sec Warning!)	<br />
Rewards<br />
The following rewards will be yours if you complete this mission:	1 x Gas Cloud Harvester I	<br />
Bonus Rewards<br />
The following rewards will be awarded to you as a bonus if you complete the mission within 2 hours, and 57 minutes 5.000.000,00 ISK	<br />
<hr />

The mission is has acceleration gates and drops you right on top of a whole pile of drones. There are 2 scramming drones that you should kill right away. There are 9 Battleship class drones (5 Swarm Preserver Alvus, 4 Alvus Controller), a bunch of cruisers and frigates, and a <strong>lot of very fragile Kamikaze drones that damage your ship when you kill them</strong>:<br />
<br />
'The Drone Kamakazi explodes, sending spurts of energy and debris in all directions. This was not a freak explosion, but a well prepared trap by the Drone Mother. Your ship takes damage!'<br />
<br />
The battleships like to sit right on top of you dealing tough damage, but, if you can get rang on them it's a lot easier to survive. I did this on a mid skilled alt using a drake I had sitting around - no t2 modules (except BCS).<br />
<br />
When you approach the can another wave spawns - 4 BS, 3 Cruisers and about a dozen sentry guns. I made the mistake of doing this before I'd killed all the drones (I had 2 BS left)<br />
<br />
'Someone has ventured close to the storage bin. As a result, rogue drones who had been dormant nearby rush into the area when the alarm is triggered. Hidden sentry guns come into view and arm their weapons. It's a trap!'<br />
<br />
T3 cruisers will have no problem, although you might want to bring a friend<br />
<hr />

I got a 2.65 Corp standing gain from part 1<br />

<br />
Yes, that is correct. I need you to clean up the mess I left behind, before things spiral out of control. I don't want to have any civilian deaths on my hands. To do this, the drone mother-computer must be taken care of. It is located near the place I just sent you. I have opened the acceleration gate leading into an adjacent deadspace pocket, which is where you'll find the target. Destroy it and return to me.	<br />
<br />
Wacky AI (2 of 2) Objectives<br />
The following objectives must be completed to finish the mission:<br />
<br />
Objective<br />
Take out the Drone Creation Compound within the Drone Complex. Report back to Erakki Kihuo in the Pioneer's Sanctuary once the objective has been completed. <br />
<br />
Location	ZJ-QOO	<br />
This site contains special ship restrictions.<br />
<br />
Rewards<br />
The following rewards will be yours if you complete this mission:	1 x Caldari Navy Random Stuff	<br />
<br />
Bonus Rewards<br />
The following rewards will be awarded to you as a bonus if you complete the mission within 3 hours 10.500.000,00 ISK<br />
<hr />

<br />
Again it's a gated complex, first pocket has 5 BS, 6 Cruiser and 4 Frigate Drones, one of which is a scramming drone.<br />
<br />
Second complex has a bunch of Cruisers, sentry guns and a 'Drone Creation Compound', shooting thie compound causes it to spawn many more cruisers when you hit structure.<br />
<br />
'The Drone Mother has launched Kamikaze Drones from the Drone Creation Compound to defend itself! More drones have also joined the fray.'<br />
<br />
After you shoot it some more (50% structure?) we get another spawn - 5 BS, 6 Cruiser and 4 Frigate with scrams. There's an Elite Drone parasite which switched targeting to my drones.<br />
<br />
'Drones from other pockets of the deadspace complex have warped into the room to defend the Drone Mother!'<br />
<br />
When you kill the cruisers in that wave you get a spawn of 5 frigates with a couple of scramming frigates in the wave<br />
These are kamikazi drones and when killed they damage my ship and my drones. ( I lost my drones this way)<br />
<br />
'The Drone Kamakazi explodes, sending spurts of energy and debris in all directions. This was not a freak explosion, but a well prepared trap by the Drone Mother. Your ship takes damage!'<br />
<br />
As the last one explodes you get a 3 more scramming frigates spawning. Killing these has no nasty surprises.<br />
<br />
No more spawns from shooting the Drone Creation Compound, but you do get this message:<br />
<br />
'The Drone Compound starts spewing out clouds of radioactive gas once it's hull starts to disintegrate.'<br />
<br />
When destroyed the drone creation compound drops a can, containing drone goo, an implant (something in the 75k LP range =130m+) and a<span class="strikethrough"> Neurotoxin recovery skillbook</span>. No other structures dropped cans. The mission is probably worth about 150million isk in terms of loot. But if it's not friendly space you're not doing it, and 29 jumps is a long way to go.<br />
