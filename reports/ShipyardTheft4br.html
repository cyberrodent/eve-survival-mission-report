<h1>Shipyard Theft, level 4</h1>

<br />
Faction: Blood Raiders<br />
Mission type: Encounter<br />
Space type: Deadspace with Gate<br />
Damage dealt: EM/Therm<br />
Recommended damage dealing: EM/Therm<br />
Webbers: Blood Wraith, Blood Disciple<br />
Scramblers: None<br />
Recommended ship classes: Battleship, HAC.<br />
<br />
<h3>Pocket 1</h3>

Group 1 is the hardest hitting group. No webifiers, so turn around and move away from the blob while tanking the group. At a safe distance (100km from next rat) blow them up. Drones didn't aggro the rest of the pocket at 50km from the next group.<br />
Anathema Matou adds: while the mission does not have drone aggro or stage aggro, the second person to warp in will get aggro from the group with the webifiers, unless that group is already aggressed.<br />
<br />
*Effective Jan. 2009, there are two versions of this mission:<br />
Version A, Group 1 will auto-aggro but Group 2 will ignore you until it is attacked. <br />
Version B, there will be no auto-aggro, but Group 2 will aggro as soon as you fire on Group 1 --&gt; HOWEVER, Group 2 can be attacked without causing aggro by Group 1.  So, if you aren't attacked by Group 1 within 20 seconds or so of warping in, move out to sniping range and attack Group 2 first.*<br />
<br />
<br />
<h4>Group 1: (Auto Aggro (approx 20k))</h4>

4x Battlecruisers (Corpatis Phantom)<br />
1x Battleship (Corpus Cardinal)<br />
<br />
After blowing this group up, take out the group with the webifiers (Group 2). No other group will be aggroed.<br />
<br />
<h4>Group 2: (approx 25k)</h4>

5x Frigates (Blood Disciple / Wraith) <strong>Webbers</strong><br />
5x Cruisers (Corpum Dark Priest / Shadow Sage) <br />
1x Battleship (Corpus Monsignor)<br />
<br />
Next three groups are consisting of short range, low damage battleships. No webifier/scrambling rats.<br />
<br />
<h4>Group 3: (approx 30k)</h4>

4x Battleships (Corpus Prophet / Archon)<br />
<br />
<h4>Group 4: (approx 40k)</h4>

5x Destroyers (Corpior Templar / Devoter)<br />
6X Battlecruisers (Corpatis Shade / Seer)<br />
<br />
<h4>Group 5: (approx 40k)</h4>

3x Battleships (Corpus Oracle / Apostle)<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<h3>Pocket 2</h3>

No webifiers or scramblers. I recommend killing the Destroyers first, then the Sentry Guns and then Battleship.<br />
Hitalorl reports: One of the structures in the second stage drops some trade goods (Uranium, Carbon, Livestock and long-limb Roes)<br />
The mission loot drops from the last rat killed.<br />
<br />
<h4>Single Group: (15km) (Automatic aggro)</h4>

2x Bloodraider Sentry Gun<br />
4x Destroyers (Corpior Templar / Devoter)<br />
6x Battlecruisers (Corpatis Shade / Seer)<br />
3x Battleships (Corpus Apostle / Monsignor)<br />
<br />
Storage Silo drops an Amarr Nexus chip (type varies...view comments below) and 50x High tech data chips.<br />
<br />
Tip: If you have a short range setup and enough to tank them easily, go for the BS first as they like to move out to over 40k range. Everything else stays nice and close.<br />

<br />
Raven Running 2x EM/TH hardners, Domi running 2x Large Remote Shield Reps on the Raven, was able to warp into 1st pocket and just aggro everything, dropped 5 Med and 5 Sentry's, sat back and let the fire rip.<br />
<br />
The only thing of note if attempting this is take out all the Apoc class BS Rats 1st, as they do a significant amount of Kinetic damage, and will chew the tank down regardless.

<span id="comment_1180"></span>There's a trick to using a domi in this mission.<br />
<br />
The first group will aggro regardless, so you need to kill that first. The trick is to launch sentry drones, get them firing on one of the ships in the first group. The second group will now aggro on one of the drones. Retrieve that drone, and let your other 4 drones pop the ship. Launch the last drone, get them to shoot the next ship, the second group aggroes, retrieve drone, repeat until everything in the first group is dead. Continue normally aggroing one group at a time.

Second pocket - heavy fire, hard to stay, 3 times jumped out, no fire on drones, BC really pain in the :)<br />
Second pocked - 3.4 mill bounty, found Amarr MY-1 Nexus Chip in silo.<br />
Total - 32 mill(Mission, bounty,loot)

<span id="comment_2847"></span>In Version B, the battleship in group 1 is not a Corpus Cardinal. Now I had forgotten my login and I'm past that stage and I'm too drunk to remember what it actually was.<br />
<br />
But anyway, it wasn't a Cardinal and group 1 did not aggro after waiting a minute or more :)

<span id="comment_3521"></span>Read the guide!!! Very important!! Flew a T2 fitted Rokh.<br />
Pocket 1:  Normal if u manage the agro. (Don't get too close, they agro. Drones too)<br />
Pocket 2: Hard, be prepared. (The damage taken is so heavy when you warp in, get shooting and follow the guide.)

<span id="comment_3791"></span>Found this mission hard in a Raven with all T2 fitting except missiles/launchers. Brought a friend along with another raven similarly fit, and it was a cake walk. I agree with taking the dessy's and BC's first. It made the mission much more manageable.

<span id="comment_4335"></span>Interesting: I got version B, but had to go AFK after initial warp in. Did not target, fire, or launch drones. Did not get any aggro, and docked up.<br />
After returning, I got version A.

<span id="comment_4545"></span>when you get a Corpus Monsignor instead of a Cardinal in group one, you got version B. <br />
<br />
did this in a Drake with t2 fit (arbalest HML) and the 2nd pocket is indeed hard of the shield! but I managed to stay above 50% while I was shooting the destroyer. once they are gone, it's cake.

<span id="comment_5353"></span>Flew a T2 fitted Raven and had very little difficulty with the mission.  I was running around a 460 DPS Blood tank according to EveHQ.  Used EM cruises all the way through.  Acolyte II's made short work of all frigs.<br />
<br />
In the last pocket, initial DPS is high (probably about 550-600).  I actually popped the battlecruisers first and set my drones on the frigs.  My shields dropped until about 3 BCs and 2 frigs were down...after that I barely needed to pulse the shield booster.<br />
<br />
Also, 25 APs and 33 TPCs mixed in with otherwise mediocre salvage.

<span id="comment_5457"></span>Easily doable in a Drake with 3x BCU's even. No need to bother with the Sentry Guns in second pocket: just move away from the big Battleships a bit; then pick them off one by one.

<span id="comment_7637"></span>I received a loot drop from the silo that included Amarr TIL-1 nexus chip. This is the only time I've completed the mission. I have no idea of droprates. I see one other commenter had a similar result. Mission was fairly easy, both pockets, T2 fit Raven. Pocket 2 was slightly heavy dps, pilots with low cap may have shield boost issues. Taking out battleships and sentries first solved the problem quickly.
