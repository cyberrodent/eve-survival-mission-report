<span id="comment_2489"></span>This mission is ridiculously hard and tedious with the limited accel gate. I did it with a Drake with 60%+ resists in all 4 damtypes. The first few times i warped in (and the gate prevents you from doing some strategic location warp-in) i barely fired my first missile volley that my shield was already down to 60%. I managed to get rid of the first group, fired at the FTL until it was about 50% structure, then the group with the elite cruiser appeared, got rid of 'em all except the elite, then the 3rd group with the 2 BS appeared. I was barely able to dent the elite cruiser's shield, so i warped out, warped back in, fired at the FTL for its remained of structure hp and when it exploded, i got the mission complete, the courrier wasn't even destroyed.<br />
<br />
So yeah it can be done if you're patient and meticulous. VERY meticulous.

<span id="comment_2983"></span>I did it in a Drake passively fitted out to Jonas Vinthyn spec on Battleclinic.<br />
Had no problems with Group 1, 50% shield.<br />
Group 3 did not trigger until the Group 2 Rodul was almost destroyed also more than 3 ships - 6 or 7 I think.  Rodul difficult to kill, needed drones (5 x Hobgoblin II).<br />
<br />
I don't know if I was lucky, but I had no problems with this mission.

<span id="comment_4269"></span>First part was difficult warped out three times when shields got down to 10%. Warped back in 3 times in a Drake with all L1 fit 1 invulnerability field 1, 1 magnetic scattering amplifier, &amp; 1 heat dissipation amplifier 1. Final two &quot;Republic Jarl&quot; bugged out on me when I started doing damage and got out of my range of 60km while they could do me at 100km. So I warped out and warped back to them within 30 KM and 40 missiles later added those two to the kill list. Mission cost me 8 hobgoblins and about 2000 widow makers.

<span id="comment_4350"></span>Did this with a Ferox loaded with 4x200mm Compressed Rails (switched between Antimatter, Plutonium and Tungsten charges depending on range), 3x Arbalest assault launchers (Flameburst), 3x Hobgoblin I's, 2x Braced Multispec Shield Matrix, 3x Large Shield Extenders, 1 Medium Core Defense Extender, 2x Medium Core Defense Purger, 2x Local Powerplant Manager, 2x Magnetic Stab I. 59 Shield hp/s passive, 47.2 EM, 57.7 Therm, 68.3 Kin, 73.6 Exp resistances. 15k Shield HP total. 155ish DPS on average.<br />
<br />
MAKE SURE you have your hardeners active, first time I jumped in, I forgot, first 3 seconds I lost half my shields.<br />
<br />
The first group was the only part I had any trouble with, I had to pop one Patriot, jump out and back, pop another Patriot jump out and back in. Popped 3 more Patriots and left the last one alive<br />
<br />
Attacked the FTL Trans, finished it off by the time group 2 spawned. Group 2 really didnt do much, the leftover Patriot did most the damage, I got down to about 1/3 shields by the time I finished them off, jumped out when group 3 spawned.<br />
<br />
Group 3 wasnt too bad,one of the Chief Republic Manadis had crazy res, so I waited till I killed everything else before I went after it. Aimed for the normal cruisers first, by then I was back down to about 1/3 shields and decided to jump out and back in. After that the 2 Battleships and elite cruiser pretty much kept my shields at 50%, once I finished one of the Battleships off, shields started climbing back up. Finished the second Battleship off then went after the elite cruiser, which took me like 5 mins to kill -_-<br />
<br />
Whole mission took about 1 hour 10 mins, including switching to my Salvage Cormorant loot/salvage.<br />
1.1m ISK from Mission<br />
1.1m ISK from Salvage<br />
1.6m ISK from Loot

<span id="comment_4409"></span>After all the above comments I was really cautious but it was quite easy, didn't even have to warp out. Perhaps CCP did make the mission easier? <br />
<br />
2.2 mil SP character, passively tanked Drake with t1 launchers and t2 resists and shield rigs. I tried to keep range as much as possible, only the 1st group almost got my shields down. I destroyed the resist cruiser last and could destroy the telescope just before the next wave could reach me. Kinetic did FAR more damage than Explosive (usually recommended for Minmatar). <br />
The battleships have very short range weapons so you can destroy them before they can reach you.

<div class="comment">
<span id="comment_4520"></span>Finished in 3 minutes and 40 seconds in mostly T2 fitted Tengu (regular T1 ammo and launchers, moderate skills).<br />
<br />
Recommended damage to deal: Kinetic.<br />
<br />
Heavy DPS on warp in (not deadly, but somewhat unusual for L3 mission). Drops close to none as soon as ship starts moving.<br />
<br />
Mission marked complete as soon as initial group (cruisers + industrial) and FTL Transmitter are destroyed.<br />
<br />
THERE IS NO NEED TO KILL ANY OTHER SPAWN. Though for a few details, read further.<br />
<br />
I took the mission twice in a row from different agents to check standing loss with and without killing the remaining Republic spawns (takes another 10 minutes to kill them all, not a big issue). Results follow  - first standing change with killing all remaining spawns, second blitz only:<br />
<br />
Caldari: 6.16 | 6.39 | 6.60<br />
Amarr: 2.11 | 2.35 | 2.58<br />
Minmatar: 0.47 | 0.10 | -0.26<br />
Gallente: -2.45 | -2.68 | -2.90<br />
<br />
Basically, there is almost no difference if you choose to blow up all remaining Republic ships for salvage/loot/tags, the pretty significant standing hit will be about the same. So while the mission can be easily blitzed with moderately fast and properly tanked cruiser, you will leave behind few millions in tags/salvage and lose standings anyway.

<div class="comment">
<span id="comment_6433"></span>FACTION BALANCING: The numbers provided by OtanaSpace are consistent with a 6% relative gain with the Caldari State (for mission completion), a 3% relative loss with the Gallente Federation (for Derived Modification), and a 1.2% relative loss and an extra 2.4% relative loss with the Minmatar Republic for Derived Modification and Combat - Ship Kill, respectively.  Derived Modification alone can't explain the Minmatar standing drops OtanaSpace observed.<br />
<br />
I would therefore suspect that you get a -2.4% loss with the Minmatar Republic for Combat - Ship Kill.

<span id="comment_6589"></span>Did this in a passive tanked Nighthawk with &gt;= 80% shield resists to all damage types; even so, my shields dropped alarmingly quickly after initial warp-in. After eliminating all but 1 of the Freedom Patriots, my shields started to recover, and I triggered and finished off both of the other groups without having to warp out. Took about 600 Scourge Heavy Missiles with some help from 5x Hobgoblin II.<br />
<br />
Don't worry about anything except the Freedom Patriots, they are the main damage dealers. If you can destroy them and your tank is still holding, you'll be able to take out the other groups with ease.

<span id="comment_6685"></span>Quite easy in drake... mby u didnt notice, but Freedom Patriot are very easy to take down (used kin heavy missiles), even light scout drones (used 5x hornet t2) eat trough them with ease. Just go without any ballistic controls, no target painters, go only into shield tank. Done with drake all t1, small shield tank/missile skills Shields never went below 60% and it took me 3-4 volleys per freedom patriot<br />
Fit used<br />
med: 2x Invu hardeners / 1 EM / 1 Therm / 2 large best named shield extenders<br />
Low: 2x Shield power relay / 1 Shield recharger / 1 power diagnostic<br />
rigs : 2 purgers 1 rigor <br />
<br />
Only Chief Republic Rodul was a tough nut to crack, with only kin damage (dunno how with other types) took about 15 volleys shot and drones on him.<br />
<br />
3rd spawn does NOT spawn after killing last freedom patriot, it spawns over time, so if u warp out/in its sure that 3rd spawn sooner or later will wait for you. <br />
<br />
Killing group 1 and 2 + destroying FTL completed mission, even tho spawn 3 appeared before i took down FTL<br />
Those 2 BS shoot only projectile turrets and one of them Bane torpedos (exp)<br />
<br />
in this fit mission took about 15 minutes.<br />
Hope that helps, have fun

<span id="comment_6821"></span>I received this mission as an L3 Caldari Storyline, and I only saw the first group.  I can't say if this was because it was a Storyline or if I managed to blitz.  However, from the comments, it doesn't sound possible to blitz.  I received no valuable loot/tags.<br />
<br />
For what it is worth, the first group was easy in a faction-fitted Gila with Garde II drones (perfect drone skills for Garde).

<span id="comment_8174"></span>While this was a pretty easy mission in my Hurricane, the standings losses were worse for me than what others reported:<br />
Caldari: +6.875%<br />
Amarr: +2.9535%<br />
Gallente: -5.0383% (!!!)<br />
Minmatar: -1.7302% and -2.4% ship kill (!!!)<br />
<br />
I was counting on the standings gain being higher overall than the losses but the losses (-9.1685%) were almost equal to the gains (+9.8285%). So don't take this one on unless you want to see-saw your faction standings in this fashion...
