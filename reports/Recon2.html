<br />
<h2>Part 2 of 3</h2>

<br />
Faction: Mercenaries<br />
Mission type: Encounter<br />
Space type: Deadspace MWD: Yes<br />
Damage dealt: All kinds<br />
Recommended damage dealing: Kinetic/Thermal<br />
Recommended ship class: Cruiser (Full Clear), Shuttle (Blitz)<br />
Recommended generic setup: Short/Mid Range Combat<br />
<br />
<h5>Objective</h5>

Fly to the acceleration gate which has been locked down by the mining corporation. See if they will let you through. Then report back to your agent.<br />
<br />
Tip:  the gate is a "large collidable object", make sure to turn that on in your overview to see it.<br />
<br />
<h4>Single Pocket</h4>

Approach the gate, approximately 60 to 75 km from warp in<br />
When you get close [10 km], or attack the station, there is an ambush by...<br />
<br />
<h5>Group 1</h5>

2x Mercenary Sentry Gun (Tower Sentry Guristas I)<br />
2x Mercenary Light Missile Battery (Angel Light Missile Battery)<br />
6x Frigates (Mercenery Elite Fighter)<br />
3x Frigates (Mercenary Fighter)<br />
1x Cruiser (Mercenary Commander)<br />
<br />
<h5>Tip</h5>

<ul><li> Completion Trigger is based on distance to the gate and not on triggering the ambush. 
</li><li> If you attack the station and trigger the ambush you will have to approach the gate anyway.</li></ul>
<br />
<h5>Blitz</h5>
 
Fly to the gate in a shuttle, trigger the ambush, warp out.<br />
<br />
<h5>Structures</h5>

Mining Station drops random loot, but has a large amount of hp.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<h2>Part 3 of 3</h2>

<br />
Faction: None<br />
Mission type: Reconnaissance<br />
Space type: Deadspace<br />
Damage dealt: Omni (All types)<br />
Extras: Gas Cloud Damage<br />
Recommended ship class: Cruiser<br />
Recommended generic setup: 10K EHP+ Omni Tank, or Pure speed<br />
<br />
<h4>Warp In</h4>

You warp directly into a cloud. Warp-out gate is 60km away, activate it to complete the mission.<br />
<br />
<strong>Toxic Cloud Wave (~every 20 second)</strong><br />
Waves deal all kinds of damage evenly and occur at 5, 25, 45, 65, 95, 115, 135, 155, 175, and 205 seconds after the initial damage. <br />
Every wave has 4 separate damage types.<br />
Total unresisted damage starts at about 200 (50 per type) and slightly goes up to about 1400 (350 per type). <br />
The final wave will be more than 4000 (more than 1000 per type) unresisted damage.<br />
See the full breakdown in the comments.<br />
<br />
<h4>Pocket 1</h4>

No enemies<br />
No Structures<br />
<br />
<h5> Mineable Asteroids</h5>

30x Plagioclase<br />
16x Pyroxeres<br />
45x Veldspar<br />
<br />
<h5>Tip</h5>
 
<ul><li> The solution for the average level 2 mission runner is obviously not to get hit by the final wave. 
</li><li> Use a fast ship with an afterburner and a buffer tank (like shield extenders) to get to the gate before that wave hits.
</li><li> There is a very large number of asteroids (91 in total) in the pocket after the Toxic Cloud</li></ul>

Remember to disable AB as you get within 5 km of gate or you may overshoot it.  Burned up several Slashers and Condors trying this earlier.  Atron ran out of cap without the battery.

<span id="comment_1528"></span>For part 3 if you need speed use a Vigil with 3 overdrives on the low slots, as it can achieve more speed than the Slasher. It can do 2101m/s with a Gistii B-Type 1mn Afterburner and proper skills at &quot;All level 5&quot;.

<span id="comment_1534"></span>Wow. Completed 3/3<br />
Minimum requirements:<br />
1. Catalyst; pure armor tanking<br />
2. NO gunnery whatsoever<br />
3. Fitting: mid slots: cap recharger 1, Y-S8 Hydrocarbon Afterbuners 1<br />
Low slots: Electrostatic Heat Diffusion Plating, Dual SheatHed Reactive Plating 1, Small armor repairer.<br />
<br />
As soon as you warp into the cloud, first activate AB, then approach acceleration gate.<br />
Meanwhile, when shield is about to collapse, active small armor repairer.<br />
At appr. 17 km activate acc. gate, cap will be empty about this time.<br />
4th wave will hit you, but then you'll already be warping out. Shield 100% damage, Armor about 50% damage, no structure damage.<br />
Just made it.

<span id="comment_1964"></span>Vahan's comment is no longer correct.  Firing at the station in 2 of 3 will get you tons of aggro, but will not complete the objective.  Essentially it'll just make the mission much harder.  Be patient and fly out to the gate.

<span id="comment_1995"></span>I used an armor-tanked Rupture with no buffer and an AB II (590 m/s), i.e. a relatively slow boat. Went straight out to the gate in 2: almost no damage at all (&gt; 80% shields). Was slow off the mark in 3 and forgot to switch on my DC II for two thirds of the way. Didn't even get into armor all the same, ended up with about 35% shields. Easy.

<div class="comment">
<span id="comment_4052"></span>On Recon (3 of 3), the schedule of actual damage done to my Dominix was as follows. I was armor tanked, but only shields took damage unless otherwise noted. My Dominix was afterburning at 284 m/s. Time is measured in seconds since the first wave hit; the first wave will hit as you come out of warp.<br />
<br />
0 seconds - 117 damage<br />
5 seconds - 161 damage<br />
25 seconds - 219 damage<br />
44 seconds - 258 damage<br />
65 seconds - 315 damage<br />
95 seconds - 335 damage<br />
115 seconds - 406 damage<br />
135 seconds - 464 damage<br />
155 seconds - 522 damage<br />
175 seconds - 900 damage<br />
204 seconds - 3200 damage (shields were taken out completely by this wave. Armor damage was minimal, but I was armor hardened.)<br />
<br />
I tried to study my combat log, but the individual damage entries were not consistent with omnidamage waves hitting a standard Tech 1 0%/20%/40%/50% resistance shield.<br />
<br />
I have deleted one of my previous comments because I made an erroneous statement about the gas cloud damage having an explosion velocity.

<div class="comment">
<span id="comment_4068"></span>I got this mission a few more times, so I took the opportunity to do some testing using shield hardeners. I brought my Dominix into Recon (3 of 3) three times, each time with a shield extender and a different hardener, and recorded the damage reported in the log. I then compared the logs and calculated the pre-resist damage.<br />
<br />
Strangely enough, the damage wave at 5 seconds was not observed by my Dominix.  But, when I used the result to fly an Atron through the next time I got the mission, the 5-second wave WAS observed.  It's possible that only fast ships will see the 5-second wave.<br />
<br />
I now believe the schedule of damage to be as follows. For each wave, the number of seconds since the first damage wave is listed followed by the four damage types in order of EM, Thermal, Kinetic, Explosive.<br />
<br />
0 seconds - 50, 30, 30, 50<br />
5 seconds - 70, 40, 40, 70 (finicky; you may or may not get hit by this)<br />
25 seconds - 90, 60, 60, 90<br />
45 seconds - 80, 100, 80, 100<br />
65 seconds - 120, 120, 90, 90<br />
95 seconds - 130, 100, 100, 130<br />
115 seconds - 140, 140, 140, 140<br />
135 seconds - 160, 160, 160, 160<br />
155 seconds - 180, 180, 180, 180<br />
175 seconds - 200, 400, 300, 400<br />
205 seconds - 1100, 1200, 900, 1200<br />
<br />
Total cumulative pre-resist damage (if you stay the entire duration) is:<br />
2320 ElectroMagnetic, 2530 Thermal, 2080 Kinetic, 2610 Explosive<br />
<br />
Any ship with more than 9,540 effective hitpoints SHOULD survive the full duration. More effective hitpoints is better, obviously; sending in a ship with 9541 effective hitpoints without self-repair capabilities would be very unwise. But 9,540 effective hitpoints is the benchmark by which you can judge whether or not your ship can eat the full damage and come out intact.<br />
<br />
As you can see, it's almost (but not quite) omnidamage, so omnitanking would be a good idea if you have the slots for it. If you absolutely must prioritize resistances, cover your explosive first; Tech 1 shieldtanking ships will naturally have this covered. The second resistance to cover is EM if you intend to jump the acceleration gate within 2.5 minutes, thermal otherwise; Tech 1 armortanking ships will naturally have this covered.

Wanted to try it in an untanked condor for the lulz, warped in, got first wave of damage (50% shield left) bookmarked acceleration gate, warped back to station and then tried warping directly to the gate.<br />
Didn't work of course but worth a try I thought... until I got damage directly after warping in, instapopping me.<br />
This means that the damage waves increase and trigger even when you are not in the pocket. Switched to a Drake, approached acceleration gate without propulsion mods, TOOK NO DAMAGE whatsoever.<br />
So, warping in once and out again, waiting for damage to pass, and then warping in again should do the deal with any ship, needs confirmation though...

<span id="comment_4797"></span>Did not test the warping out theory. The third part was easily completed in condor with AB, Small SB, and Overdrive injector, all of which were T2. Finished with 75% armor remaining.

<span id="comment_4862"></span>With 395m/s speed you will be able to avoid the final wave damage.<br />
I suggest going atleast 420m/s+ for easy clear.

<span id="comment_5735"></span>Warping out no longer works. When you warp in again the waves just start again (not sure if from step one). <br />
Krept all the way to the gate in a vexor (shield extender II, Damage control II, no MWD or AB). Took only shield damage, used the acceleration gate, bookmarked the Asteroid belt and jumped into my Hulk.<br />
Damage began building up on warp in. Last wave got me into 30% armor - despite shield booster running and restoring the shield to almost 100% before final wave.<br />
After final wave no more damage received, even though Hulk only made 80m/s.<br />
PS: Not worth the effort, roids are quite small (Pyroxeres 5 - 12k). If you log in after DT an ordinary belt yields larger roids.

<span id="comment_5854"></span>I warped out as soon as I entered because I had forgotten to fit a MWD, When I re-entered I was blown up right away in a ship that has survived 3/3 many times before.

<span id="comment_6060"></span>3/3 completed in condor with MWD, overdrive injector and small shield extender. 25% shields remaining. I suggest flying manually to a point slighty above or below the gate or you might stuck on it as your ship tries to turn on a dime at 3000m/s lol.

<span id="comment_6292"></span>I tested the warp in/out theory. Worked fine on my alt(who had the mission) but doesn't seem to work for my main who was going to go mine. <br />
<br />
I warped in in a Caldari shuttle on the toon that had the mission, took the first hit from the first wave and immediately warped to dock. I waited till the time it said the last wave pulses(205 seconds). Then warped back out and flew to the acceleration gate without taking any damage. I then tried the same with my toon in the retriever. Went out, took damage, warped to dock, waited, went back out and took damage again like it had started over.

<span id="comment_6403"></span>OK. I have done it but it was ridiculus - no damage taken at all for the second time.<br />
First i tried to make it with fast frigate - after second wave I warped out with shield almost 0% and it wasn't even a half way.<br />
2 minutes later I was back in passive-tanked Caracal and tried again - there was no radiation waves at all...<br />
Mission completed :) Probably bug of some kind...
