<h5>Blitz</h5>

You can loot the Tomb however the mission does not complete until ALL ships are kill from all waves<br />
<br />
<h5>Mineable Asteroid info</h5>

While I am not a miner, there seemed to be massive amounts of Veldspar roids in pocket, 50+ with at least two at over 16km radius.<br />
<br />
<h5>Tip:</h5>

The ship kill faction penalty is around 1% while the turn in is closer to 5%.<br />
Beware of the proximity mines, they do around 900 damage. They can be detonated by shooting with any weapon (does not need to hit)<br />

<span id="comment_6958"></span>Yes! the trigger was not State Shukuro Nagashin. It was the first State Shukuro Shogun that I killed and there were 3 of them. I was immediately Nos'ed when the next wave spawned and was target jammed. I am not goin back without help.

<span id="comment_7932"></span>Completed in Vexor Navy Issue with high armor resists (90%+ thermal/kinetic), active tank with single MAR II. Used a combination of heavy and sentry drones (Warden/Wasp I).<br />
<br />
My spawns and triggers were somewhat different. In Group 1 trigger was one of the State Shogun; in Spawn 1 - State Nagashin; and in Spawn 2 - State Bishamon.<br />
<br />
Upon landing on grid closest NPC was at about 55 km. Incoming DPS was fairly heavy, but still manageable. Deployed sentry drones and killed frigates/cruisers immediately. State Nagashin was orbiting just outside of my targeting range, so I proceeded to engage one of the State Shogun battleships. Unfortunately, this turned out to be the trigger for Spawn 1, which appeared and aggroed immediately.<br />
<br />
At this point I was overwhelmed by the incoming DPS (primarily from the 2 State Nagashin BS). I had just enough time to target and destroy State Gassin (the NOS BC in Spawn 1) and warp out. NOTE: State Gassin was closing distance very quickly; it seems to be packing an MWD!<br />
<br />
It became obvious that sentry drones will not be able to deal with the remaining NPCs, given the incoming DPS and my tank. At this point I loaded heavy drones and fitted NOS (2x Medium Diminishing Power System Drain I). Warped back on grid and targeted one of the State Nagashin BS; closed distance quickly with MWD, then orbited him at something like 1000 m. Engaged NOS and deployed heavy drones. Orbiting in close proximity to him reduced the incoming DPS to nearly zero. After he went down I targeted and destroyed the other Nagashin BS, which triggered Spawn 2, but the NPCs did not pose much of a problem. (however, watch out for State Gassin!)<br />
<br />
Upon destroying the trigger in Spawn 2, Spawn 3 appeared right on top of me - it had 2 frigates, but neither of them webbed or warp scrambled. Also there was another State Nagashin BS in addition to the other battleships, but none of the NPCs posed much of a problem at this proximity. Light drones dispatched the frigates, then heavy drones chewed through the rest.<br />
<br />
On 2 or 3 occasions the NPCs targeted my drones; had to bring them in and redeploy. Also there was some ECM from State Gassin.<br />
<br />
Total loot and salvage was worth over 75 million (72 million of which was in tags). I would probably consider farming this mission if I get it again.<br />
<br />
Standing gain with Gallente (with Social at level 5): 9.375%<br />
Standing loss with Caldari due to derived modification: -2.855%<br />
Standing loss with Caldari due to ship kills: -0.138%<br />
<br />
Overall a fun mission to do in Vexor, although somewhat time consuming.
